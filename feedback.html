          Hi everyone, I got accepted to New York onsite immersive Dec cohort a week ago. I have been busy moving and finally have some time writing this to share my experiences. I took three technical interviews in total and here are the dates and problems I ran into.
          <br> • 1st Technical Interview (9/10)
          <br> - Type: Traditional
          <br> - Duration: 1h
          <br> - Feedback Date: 9/20
          <br> - Variable declaration
          <br> - Function declaration
          <br> - Callback function (one-line function, addOne)
          <br> - Callback function (one-line function, subtractOne)
          <br> - Higher Order Function(String manipulation - Potion)
          <br> • 2nd Technical Interview (10/15)
          <br> - Type: Traditional
          <br> - Duration: 1h
          <br> - Feedback Date: 10/18
          <br> - Variable declaration
          <br> - Callback Function
          <br> - Higher Order Function
          <br> - Closure
          <br> - Recursion (Basic)
          <br> - OOP constructor
          <br> - OOP method
          <br> • 3rd Technical Interview (10/25)
          <br> - Type: Traditional
          <br> - Duration: 1h
          <br> - Feedback Date: 10/28
          <br> - OOP constructor
          <br> - OOP method
          <br> - Recursion (Hard-Construct 2D array)
          <br> Overall tips:
          <br> :exceptionally_fast_parrot: About pacing - I was worrying if I over explained sometimes that takes more time to get through problems. This really depends on people’s perspective. For people who would love to challenge themselves to crack the technical interview on the first try, pacing is essential. Reaching the hard parts and solving 8-10 problems in total within an hour definitely requires a lot more than that. I’ll say it’s an art of balancing a variety of metrics. For people who prefer breaking the process down like me, I would suggest focusing on quality of problem-solving first. For each problem, show off what you’ve got to impress the interviewer even just a simple one. Some brownie points such as, use the ES6 syntax; or while testing, read a test case in a strict technical fashion e.g. “I’m logging the evaluated result of calling xx function when passing xx value to the console and I’m expecting the result xxx” ;
          <br> :white_check_mark:Build up your own problem-solving routine - I benefited from this a lot since my second technical interview.For every problem I solved during the interview, I followed these steps:
          <br> - Read the prompt;
          <br> - Define the input and output of the function;
          <br> - Write the code of function declaration (only the function label, parameters, put the curly braces in place);
          <br> - Set up the test cases with expected result;
          <br> - Communicate the overall strategy;
          <br> - Write pseudocode;
          <br> - Write real code;
          <br> - Test with test cases and debug…
          <br> - From step a-d, I found it is helpful to have test cases ready before I started to talk about solution. It helped me to understand the prompt in depth. And I got positive feedback on this practice from the interviewer.
          <br> - People might have other sequence they’d prefer to follow. It does not matter only if the routine serves thought process and efficiency. Practice with routine couple of times before interviews.
          <br> :exploding_head:For String/Array Manipulation problems - For the specific group, the purpose is to test control flow, looping and array/string methods. If stuck, it will slow us to get to closure/recursion/OOP. The tricky thing is that the interview problems would be harder and slightly different than problems on CSX/CSbin. Beyond that, I’ll recommend to look for couple of more challenging problems, good examples are: potion problem(l think people shared this before in the channel), compress, uncompress, anagrams (from Structy). I ran into the potion problem in my first technical interview and I was totally bummed. Looking back, the problem is feasible without knowing any further knowledge but it need time, practice and repetition to feel comfortable solving it during interview. For people who will be in CS prep, Problem of the Day are a good resource to understand fundamental patterns and the efficient execution of code in common groups.
          <br> Thank you everyone. I really appreciate the enthusiasm in the channel:fire::sparkling_heart:! Feel free to ask me if you have any question!

          Interview : 2nd interview
          <br> 1st question was to declare an array
          <br> 2nd question was to check for even
          <br> 3rd question was to create a func that accepts an array and a callback func. Then to return the index of the last elem that resulted true when passed in the callback
          <br> 4. An easy closure problem
          <br> 5. An easy recursion problem. the func will have an input of an array and callback. the aim was to get a new array with the elements being the result of invoking the callback func while passing each element as an argument.
          <br> 6. OOP problem. the aim was to create an obj that acts like a set (so similar to the obj acting like an array).
          <br> Tips:
          <br> - Watch out for the Time. Always practice while timing yourself
          <br> - Do the problems from previous interviews. In my opinion , code wars and leetcode are a bit advanced and would be a waste of time.
          <br> - Warm up with some coding before the interview
          <br> - Practice using map, filter, and forEach methods.

          Hello everyone. I got the call saying I was being offered admittance into the Central Remote this coming January after my first technical interview. To be honest I was expecting to have to conduct a second one. I went so far as to schedule another mock with @Lucas  before I even heard the results. Speaking of which I don’t think I would be typing this if it wasn’t for him, and @Alyssa Denary for offering mock interviews. As well as everyone else who has posted their experience in this channel.
          <br> First Interview: 10/27
          <br> - Variable declaration
          <br> - String function
          <br> - Callback
          <br> - Closure
          <br> - Recursion
          <br> - OOP constructor
          <br> - OOP method
          <br> - OOP method
          <br> Overall:
          <br> I think for me the biggest issue when I first started doing mock interviews was my pacing. I could get through the problems eventually, but I was just so slow. I ended up doing 4 mock interviews before the technical and I definitely got more comfortable with the format/pacing as I progressed through each mock. The questions do seem to follow a similar progression so when practicing I would seek out problems which seemed similar in style to the mock interview questions I was given. Everyone is different, but for me personally I spent a lot of time on closure/OOP and would go through any related CSBin, CSX, or past mock interview questions that were related. I can’t stress enough how impactful the mock interviews were to me. I would take the feedback and slowly build towards better communication, pseudocode, and general problem-solving ability. They also helped solidify my ability to think out loud during problem sets, and without that familiarity I likely would have been silent during much of the technical.
          <br> Feedback Received:
          <br> +Technical communication
          <br> +Ability to think out loud
          <br> +JavaScript knowledge
          <br> -Solutions could be simpler
          <br> -Afraid of the for loop
          <br> -Changing approach is ok
          <br> Thanks again to everyone on this channel for sharing their experiences. If anyone has any questions feel free to contact me.

          Hi everyone, I just took my first technical interview with the sweetest interviewer...yet I was still sweating buckets and typing with trembling fingers LOL
          <br> So. I know 100% I will be called for a second interview because I got stuck on the closure problem and never made it to any OOP problems. I thought I understood closure pretty well, until I had to make my own test cases. I just completely blanked on function definitions vs function calls, assigning function definitions to variables using arrow function syntax, etc. Little stuff that made me realize I can't depend so much on CSX pre-written test cases. That threw me off the most!! Make sure you practice writing your own tests.
          <br> So info about interview:
          <br> - Interview date: 10/28/2022
          <br> - Interview number: the very first
          <br> - Interview type: traditional
          <br> - Duration: 1 hour
          <br> - Cohort: ECRI in January/CTRI in January
          <br> Questions:
          <br> 1. Simple variable declaration question
          <br> 2. string manipulation
          <br> 3. callback
          <br> 4. closure
          <br> 5. recursion
          <br> I was able to finish the recursion question in the last few minutes, but like I said earlier, I was stuck debugging the closure function for a while. I had all my code written. Then I just...blanked when my test cases were returning the function definition and not my result. My interviewer gave me advice to push me in the right direction so I could talk through my debugging process without melting into a puddle XD XD
          <br> But yes...I realized how spoiled CSX made me. I think to practice for the next one I will use CSBin and add in at least one more test case that I create myself.
          <br> Obviously I just completed my interview so I don't have the feedback yet, but once I get it I will update everyone here!! I wish I found this channel earlier. I am going to try to sign up for a mock interview to prep for the next one, thanks to all of you in advance

          Overview of my interviews:
          <br> First Interview - taken Friday, Oct 10th
          <br> 1. Variable declaration/assignment
          <br> 2. String manipulation function
          <br> 3. Callback/HOF
          <br> 4. Closure/HOF
          <br> 5. Recursion with a string input
          <br> 6. OOP: create a constructor function
          <br> I knew there was a chance OOP could be covered (my test was a few hours before the “official” announcement on slack) but I spent a majority of my prep focusing on the difficult closure problems that I struggled with in mocks. Figured there was no point in studying OOP if I couldn’t even get to those problems! I leaned heavily on MDN and took my best shot at the prompt but I was pretty sure I’d be asked for a second interview starting with OOP.
          <br> Second Interview - taken Wednesday, October 19th
          <br> 1. OOP: constructor
          <br> 2. OOP: Add a method accessible to all instances
          <br> 3. OOP: another method but much trickier
          <br> 4. … a real doozy. A “stumper” unrelated to OOP.
          <br> Overall takeaways:
          <br> - Technical communication: Sometimes people miss the forest for the trees with this. Yes, there are words you should avoid and others you should say, but good technical communication is always rooted in comfort with the material (in my opinion). Thoroughly understanding what you are asked to do and how you’ll go about solving it will go a long way in speaking clearly and effectively. Conversely, a lack of understanding becomes very apparent when communicating your approach, thought process, etc. (especially with OOP).  In other words, once you are really comfortable with the subject matter a lot of the technical communication will come naturally: you’ll know what to say because you deeply understand the shortcomings of the incorrect terms and the reasoning behind the proper ones.
          <br> - Pseudo code: there are already a lot of great resources here but I’ll just reiterate what I think is the most essential point: keep it casual! Your pseudo code shouldn’t include specific method names, lengthy descriptions of what will happen, etc. Think of it as a recipe written for someone who knows how to code, but maybe not in JavaScript.
          <br> - Tough problems: Even more so lately, the exam will throw tricky variations and wrinkles at you, even in the earlier problems. A few things to keep in mind with these:
            <br> - Don’t get quiet! It’s easy to be overwhelmed and nervous, and if you’re like me, you start running through all the different ways you may approach the problem in your head. Verbalizing this process is a great way to demonstrate your knowledge while keeping your interviewer in the loop.
            <br> - Keep a positive attitude! Interviewers are looking to see your mental/behavioral approach too; tackling these problems with curiosity and enthusiasm goes a long way.
            <br> - Know your stuff! There’s no substitute for straight up knowledge and ability, and the more practice you have, the better you will fare. And think of coding as a trade, like carpentry: acquire all the tools you can and know them inside-and-out . Then, when you come across a weird/complex problem, you’ll have a full arsenal to choose from and can identify the best tool for the job.
          <br> Hope this helps!

          Hey all, found out I was admitted to the EC full-time cohort in January after two interviews like @Huse (congrats to him!). Going to take some to think about it over the weekend but I'm just glad to know finally since feedback has been a bit slow to get to us East Coast/Central applicants. Thanks to my mock interviewers from this channel @April Sanders, @Camille Salter, @Cee L, @Lucas, and @Alyssa Denary. Super appreciate all of your time and helpful comments! And also thanks to anyone else I talked/ranted to about how I have no idea what I'm doing with my life lol.
          <br> There are a few examples of people detailing their interviews so I'll just give a general rundown and if anyone has specific questions feel free to reach out.
          <br> First Interview:
          <br> -Variable declaration
          <br> -HOF problem using declared variables
          <br> -Sort of weird closure problem (probably the hardest on this interview)
          <br> -Easy recursion problem
          <br> -OOP set that I didn't do great on
          <br> Second:
          <br> -Really similar format to the first which sort of threw me off
          <br> -Two HOF problems with some string manipulation
          <br> -OOP set different from the first interview
          <br> I think having strong technical communication/problem-solving skills in the first interview made it so that the second one was just brushing up on things. And I will say that the advice they give to not stop talking even when you're stuck really helped me. I was stuck on a string manipulation problem in the second interview for much longer than I wanted to be and thought it reflected poorly on me. But then when I got my call, they mentioned that my ability to keep composure and work through blocks like that was a strength. So at least for me, it's hard to be objective on what really happened after the fact (esp. when the feedback takes a bit to get to us), but just do your best! Feel free to reach out with any questions or if you might need a mock interview.

          Hello! I was accepted into the west coast Jan 30th cohort, and wanted to say thank you to everyone on this channel - it's been amazingly helpful!! Super special thank you to @Huse for giving me a mock interview and very valuable and actionable feedback :smile:
          <br> For interview prep, I focused on my weak areas: technical communication (high level strategy, pseudocoding, communicating while coding, thinking out loud through roadblocks), recursion, and OOP.
          <br> For technical communication, I went through CSX and CS Bin problems and recorded myself while solving them. Then I would listen to the recording as objectively as I could, make some mental notes, and try to incorporate improvements on the next round. I did this over and over until the cows came home... and of course, nothing beats objective feedback like a mock interview, but recordings helped a lot when the mock interview calendar was full!  :slightly_smiling_face:
          <br> Added bonus from the recordings - after a while , you start to get a feel for how long you're spending on problems based on the length of the recording. This was helpful since I was also worried about timing and talking too much / too little / spending too much time on a single problem (how to find the right balance!?)
          <br> Some other things I personally find useful for encountering recursion and stumper problems:
          <br> Working through examples (i.e., 'if I call function X with argument A, I should expect result B. If I pass in argument C, I should expect result D.. ') and looking for patterns. This will also give you an opportunity to ask your interviewer clarifying questions, as well as identify and create test cases and edge cases!
          <br> Breaking the problem down... What is the simplest possible input or scenario you could work with? Figure that one out, and try to work your way up from there.
          <br> Hope this helps - good luck everyone!!

          Hi team, I got into the West Coast December cohort following my 2nd interview. I got the call the day after the interview. I am extremely grateful for the support, advice and tips from this channel, Y’all are amazing! I want to shout out @Lucas, @Camille Salter for giving me mock interviews, @Alyssa Denary and @Sean Flynn have generously shared so much with me.
          <br> I took one week to prepare my 2nd interview and heres some feedback I got from those two interviews:
          <br> - Solidify your understanding of OOP and how to implement them.
          <br> - write tests for cases that may result in all possible output.
          <br> - Time management. Speed up the process.
          <br> - Use ES6 syntax more often if you can.
          <br> - If there is any way I can help you with anything, please let me know. I wish everyone the best of luck in their interviews too!

          Hello everyone, I took my first technical interview about a week ago. I have been called back for a second interview. The feedback I was given was to use es6 syntax more often and to practice with objects. My advice to people taking their first interview would be to not be too afraid. Many of the questions are not too difficult. If you’re doing mocks and CSX, you will have adequate practice. And if a problem is easy, try to work a little faster, it helps save time for later problems.
          <br> Having said this, would anyone be willing to do mock interviews with me within the coming week before my next interview. The topics would be more on recursion, OOP, and possibly async. There’s not much availability for the kind people on the spreadsheet, so this may be a shot in the dark.

          Hi everyone, this is how my interview went on 14-SEP. I received acceptance on 29-SEP, so two weeks later
          <br> Here's how it went:
          <br> - Interview date: Sept 14
          <br> - Interview number: 1
          <br> - Interview type: Traditional
          <br> - Duration: 1h
          <br> Problems:
          <br> Problem 1: Same as everyone, first problem was creating a variable. If it specifically says variable, use let if it's an obj or array, use const . 
          <br> Problem 2: Si mple for loop question to find min max of an array.
          <br> Problems 3, 4: Simple one-liner functions such as addOne, subtractOne, isOdd, isEven, isNegative, isPositive. You get the gist of it. These are the helper/callback functions that will be used in a later question.
          <br> Problem 5 Callbacks: Use all the functions that you created in problems 3,4 as callbacks. My question was a string manipulation question: loop through each character of the string, if satisfying a condition, assign the current char position to the invocation of the callback function. I think we usually refer this question as potion question.
          <br> Problem 6 String Manipulation/Handle: isPalindrome.
          <br> Problem 7 Recursion: getLength
          <br> Problem 8 Closures:  I had a closure question for returning specific element from the input object.
          <br> Problem 9, 10 Challenge question: Similar to everyone, I got question for transpose and rotate 90o of a 2D array.
          <br> My Experience:
          <br> Time went by so fast. The more I talked and treated the interviewer as a teammate, the more relaxed I became.
          <br> Feedback I got from interview:
          <br> - Good technical knowledge. My instructor did not say any further than this
          <br> They like that I asked for edge cases like:
          <br> - Am I expecting only positive number, negative number
          <br> - What if the input is this, how do you want me to handle
          <br> - What if after I return all elements in my object, what do you want me to return next if we invoke this function again?
          <br> - Am I always expecting numeric input or a string or a mixture
          <br> I got compliment on my debugging. My instructor asked me what was going on my mind when I debugged, I said:
          <br> First of all, I always make sure my indentation is correct. If the indentation is wrong, I know I'm missing some closing brackets or having syntax error in previous lines so I fix those immediately
          <br> Then when running code and we receive an error message. I learn to be familiar of the meaning of the error message. If this is the first time I see that error message, I will google it to understand what kind of situation would result in the error.
          <br> If I know what the error mean, then I will fix my code accordingly.
          <br> If I have location where I think the error is coming from, I will comment out the part of the code until I know exactly what line causing the error and fix it
           <br> If running the code and I got incorrect result (a.k.a logical error)
          <br> I start tracing/skimming my code until I find an area that I think cause the incorrect result, then I use console.log to ensure the function is working the way I want it to do
          <br> Hope this helps!

          My approach over the month of prep  and 2 Technical Interviews  can be boiled down to the list below. Hopefully it helps someone.
          <br> Interview Prep
          <br> - CSX & CS Bin – I repeated these over and over again. It’s not just about refactoring your code; it is also about getting used to the questions to the point where a specific question triggers a specific approach in you. Because every single minute counts, you want to spend as little time as possible on each question, so having your approaches ready really cuts down on time spent thinking up a solution.
          <br> - Pair Programming – This is the space to make mistakes, try out new things and have someone carry you over the hurdles that you are facing. If your partner is more skilled, you learn a lot. If they are around the same level as you, then you have room to experiment, fail, and solidify your understanding of the concepts. If you are the more skilled partner, it is an opportunity to teach and grow someone else as you have been grown.
          <br> - Mock Interview – This is the place to get that technical interview feel, and yes, it is extremely stressful. Watching that hour trickle away as you struggle with one problem can feel quite soul-crushing, but you keep doing it and it keeps getting better each time you do it. This is the time to:
          <br> - Practice your technical communication with an objective observer
          <br> - Figure out whether your pseudocode is too sparse or too long
          <br> - Get used to coming up with test cases and edge cases
          <br> - Encounter those mind-bending string manipulation questions (my personal hell). I had not encountered these before, and really struggled with them.
          <br> - Encounter recursion problems like you haven’t seen them on CS bin
          <br> - Above all, just gain the confidence to express yourself in a technical scenario.
          <br> - You will have to ask clarifying questions, especially when it is a complex question that is not immediately clear
          <br> - You will have to talk through your thought process
          <br> - You may have to explain why you have changed your strategy mid-way
          <br> Interview
          <br> - High Level Strategy – This is a general picture of how you want to approach the problem. Make it as clear as possible without it being detailed.
          <br> - Pseudocode – This is a step by step written record of what you want to do. You want to find a balance between too detailed and too short, a balance that I am still working on. In my initial mock interviews, I was informed that my pseudocode was too short, and in my first technical I was told it was way too detailed. Ideally don’t spend so much time pseudocoding that it eats into your coding time.
          <br> - Technical Communication / Coding – These two occur simultaneously. Because of all the work leading up to the interview, the coding bit is rarely the problem. Talking as you code though … can be tricky. My personal approach is to start speaking before you code, this way you don’t forget to communicate as you code. Try to be as precise as possible and mention everything from template literals (I forgot this in my 2nd technical interview), to invoking a function. I even mention line numbers, in case I go back up the code and add something to the code, or change something in the code, this way your interviewer is with you all the way.
          <br> - Overall Summary – In the event that your strategy got turned around a few times while solving a problem, take time at the end to walk through your solution again to reorient your interviewer.
          <br> - Test Cases & Edge Cases – My first mock interviewer I had no idea what an edge case was, by the end I sort of did. I think of an edge case as a test that your code was not designed to accommodate. Like passing in a string instead of a number, or only accounting for an array with elements and not an empty one etc. Try to think about possible edge cases as you solve a problem, this way your solution can handle any test case introduced by the interviewer. That said, you will not always be able to account for all edge cases, if your code fails a test try to go back and account it for it within your code. The more edge cases you encounter, the better you become at anticipating them in the future.
          <br> - Finally, failing feels terrible, but it also shows you what you need to work on. There are things that will take you some time to get e.g., recursion without using loops, native methods, or the length property, and sometimes doing them under pressure you will falter. But you’ve come this far, so clearly you are in the right place, doing the right thing, and with a bit more practice you’ll get it.

          Following @Lucas post
          <br> My first interview was yesterday, and here's how it went:
          <br> - Interview date: Sept 27
          <br> - Interview number: 1
          <br> - Interview type: Traditional
          <br> - Duration: 1h
          <br> Problems:
          <br> Problem 1: Same as Lucas and @April Sanders, first problem was creating a variable. If it specifically says variable, use let if it's an obj or array,  try using  const .
          <br> Problem 2: Involved simple iteration like using a for-loop or for-of loop. This was simple.
          <br> Problems 3, 4, 5: Problems that returned booleans. Think, check if this number is a negative, or an even number...etc Like Lucas and April's, these were simple one-liner conditional statements. I think they're testing you on ES6 syntax, like the arrow functions, and making sure you're not using unnecessary else statements.  I got feedback that I should have used arrow functions.
          <br> Problem 6 Callbacks: Use all the functions that you created in problems 3,4,5 as callbacks. They are making you rebuild the 'Every' method.   I would say this was a lot easier than the problems in CSX. If you could do the problems in CSX, you will definitely know how to do this one. Also I got feedback from @Vivian O in the mock interview to try to use array methods like map or filter, instead of using for-loops for every problem. Even if you want to use for loops, explain why you choose not to use the array methods and explain why using a for-loop is the best approach. I used for-loops for every problem, but I explained why and that's probably why my interviewer let it slide.
          <br> Problem 7:  isPalindrome, I don't think you have to solve this one recursively. But I think the reason they give this problem is because they want to see if you write unecessary code, or because of time/space complexity? I am not too familiar with those concepts, but I know that the loop doesn't have to go through the entire string to check if it's a palindrome. You could just check half of the string, or once you find an instance of 2 letters that don't match, you can just exit out of the loop early and return false. No need to iterate through the entire string to check if it's a palindrome. I got feedback that my space complexity was good, but not time complexity.
          <br> Problem 8 Closures:  If you did closure problems in CSX, you're fine. Think beginning closure problems in CSX.
          <br> Problem 9 Recursion: Like Lucas and April's, this one was a simple recursion problem. But the language kind of threw me off a bit, because it said you can't use loops or JS methods.  Again, think beginning recursion problems in CSX, like the first 2-3. I would say even the first CSX recursion problem is harder than this one.
          <br> Problem 10: Like Lucas and April's this was the 2D array problem. This was a super duper hard problem that I didn't finish. I think they give this to you on purpose to see how you handle being stuck. I had a mock interview with @Nicholas and he mentioned that he had a game plan for when he got stuck, and that advice very useful for the actual interview. Just keep thinking out loud and if you have an outcome that isn't what you expect, start from the top and console log to make sure all your expected values are correct. I'm not sure if this is good advice on getting stuck, so lmk what you would do, I'd like to learn too!
          <br> Feedback I got from interview:
          <br> - Good: Easy to follow, verbalized the entire process, organized pseudocode,  liked that I included inputs/outputs, wrote and console logged test cases before solving a problem (I had around 2-3 test cases), no unnecessary else statements
          <br> - Improvement: use more ES6 syntax (arrow functions, switch statements), could add more edge cases, good use of space complexity but need to think more about time complexity
          <br> Make sure you schedule as many mock interviews with @Lucas and @Ruqayaah S., these 2 are a wealth of knowledge. I did horrible in my first mock with Lucas, and only did 2 problems. It takes practice, and it's a different experience from pair programming and solving problems yourself. Also join the study group on Saturdays by @Chris K., also a wealth of knowledge! You learn so much from his feedback as well as how other people solve problems.
          <br> Hope this helps! And feel free to message me if you have questions or want a mock interview!! I got A TON of help from these guys over the past month, so I need to pay it forward!

          Hey Lucas! This is a great idea, I’ll share my experience as well :
          <br> Interview date: September 9th
          <br> - Interview number: 1 (accepted after first TI)
          <br> - Interview type (pair-programming/traditional): Traditional
          <br> - Duration: 1 hour (the entire interview was dedicated to problem solving)
          <br> - Cohort : CTRI - Jan 16th
          <br> I went through 10-ish challenges :
          <br> My interview was very similar to Lucas’ interview :
          <br> - first problem was creating an array
          <br> - the next four problems were helper functions that were one-liners using a function expression
          <br> - the following problem was a callback that asked me to use the previous helper functions
          <br> - my next problem was string manipulation - I was asked to refactor this problem multiple times (isPalindrome, for those who are familiar); I don’t think being asked to refactor this much is normal, but it’s helpful to feel comfortable solving problems in different ways (recursively, using methods, iteratively without any methods, etc)
          <br> - then, I had a recursive problem that was very basic and similar to what is in CSX
          <br> - after that, I had a closure problem of similar difficulty to CSX problems - after solving the closure problem, I was asked to go back and edit the code slightly to produce a different outcome
          <br> - stumper problem - transpose. I didn’t finish this problem  (I didn’t know how to, even though I’d seen it before), but I did try to talk through what I was doing
          <br> Thoughts / Tips / Advice :
          <br> - For me, it was helpful to have a consistent way to solve each problem. If you don’t already have it, it can be helpful to have a rhythm (example - for each problem, I’d : read instructions & set up my input/output  > declare function & set up function definition > create test cases > take my hands off the keyboard (to reduce my own anxiety and tendency to start pseudocoding prematurely) and explain my verbal strategy > put hands back on keyboard & pseudocode, rereading problem if necessary > code / debug / re-summarize if needed)
          <br> - Treat the interview like you’re teaching them how to solve the problem; making it conversational definitely reduced anxiety for me
          Do mock interviews (obviously lol)! I can 100% say that I wouldn’t have gotten in without doing my first few mock interviews. I think 2-4 interviews seems to be a sweet spot, and gives a chance to get comfortable with your own rhythm and pace. Not everyone needs them though. If you can talk aloud while solving, or maybe even record yourself and go back and watch the recording, that can serve the same purpose. Definitely based on the individual!
          <br> - As others have said, be mindful of syntax and using correct terminology, and if you use a method, or a way to solve a problem (recursion vs iteration, for example), take a second to explain why you’re choosing to do that - I think the interviewers like to see that you know why you’re doing what you’re doing
          <br> - lastly, it helped me to mentally visualize what was going on while I was reading. so if a problem involves two arrays and an object as parameters, I would see two arrays and an object in my mind and I’d imagine manipulating the keys, elements, functions etc to get your desired outcome. I know everyone’s mind works differently, but that definitely helped me! hopefully this makes sense, just ignore this bullet if it doesn’t lol :sweat_smile:
          <br> I did reach out to admissions about OOP/Async, here’s what I was generally told (don’t hold it against me if this isn’t 100% true for you though lol, things could have changed since I reached out at the beginning of September) --- if you’re heading into your second interview, you will likely have OOP if you make it to that point in the interview. If it’s your first interview and it’s scheduled during September, it’s unlikely that you’ll see OOP. Excerpt from response from admissions : “We are not officially making changes to the interview until early October, but we recommend getting familiar with OOP and Async regardless, as it’s always been possible that those concepts appear on our technical interview.”
          <br> If you have any other questions, feel free to DM me! I received so much help on this channel, and it made a big difference in my experience so I love to help others as well!

          Hey folks,
          <br> I’ve done my technical interview and wanted to note down something based on my personal experience, hopefully it keeps you updated.
          <br> - Interview date: Aug 07
          <br> - Interview number: 1
          <br> - Interview type: Traditional
          <br> - Duration: 1h
          <br> - I went through 9 challenges:
          <br> The 1st challenge was a warmed-up question that asked me to declare a variable, I think this one tested us on how to declare and initialize variables, so we should consider using a let or const keyword to create variables depending on different situations.
          <br> The next 2 challenges involved using simple iterations/loops to work with an array of numbers and strings, I think they were not complex, we should know how to use conditions inside the loop to branch our program, and carefully handle indices of characters from the string, etc.
          <br> The next 2 were just helper functions and they were so straightforward that I could use one line of code to complete these tasks.
          <br> The next one was a string manipulation problem and I think this was one of the challenging problems in this set (compared to others). It was something like ‘AB potions’, and I had to traverse through the string to update specific characters based on the requirement. Well, at first, I was a bit confused because I was thinking of some variants of this problem, like ‘A’ and ‘B’ could appear multiple times, ‘A’ and ‘B’ could be at the beginning or at the end of the string, and ‘A’ and ‘B’ could be consecutive in the string, etc, so I recommend you to clarify some edge cases with the interviewer since they may just want us to work with simple cases.
          <br> The next one was a closure problem and it wasn’t different from what we’ve done on CSX and CSBin, so I didn’t have any difficulties with this one.
          <br> The next one was a recursion problem, but again it was very similar to what we’ve practiced on CSX and CSBin, so I did it!
          <br> And the last one was a challenge on a 2D array, we should know how to work with multi-dimensional arrays to complete this one. Unfortunately, I got some bugs on my first attempt, and after trying to fix them, I came up with a working solution using loops. However, later I realized that it's better to solve this one with recursion.
          <br> ...And, I failed on this one :sweat_smile: Actually, I have failed many times, so just keep practicing :dart:
          <br> DISCLAIMER: This review is just from my personal experience, from what I got from my actual technical interview. But hopefully, it gives you some inputs to better prepare!
          <br> Best of luck with your interviews!
