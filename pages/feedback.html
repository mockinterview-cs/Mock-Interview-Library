          Hello everyone,
          <br> I just got accepted into the PTRI program that starts in March! I just wanted to take a moment to thank this amazing community and all of the support I received here.
          <br> Special shoutout to Lucas and Jimmy, who took the time to do mock interviews with me. That really helped me a lot when I took the technical interview and I couldn't have done it without their help.
          <br> In preparation for the technical interview, I went over CSX and CSBin questions twice, and also made sure to do the GitHub questions, especially the OOP questions. This really helped me build a solid foundation and gave me confidence during the interview.
          <br> This Slack channel has been an invaluable resource and the support and encouragement I received here made all the difference. So thank you to everyone who has been a part of this community, your advice and guidance have been invaluable.
          <br> If anyone has any questions about my experience or preparation in general, please feel free to DM me. I'd be more than happy to help in any way I can.
          <br> I'm looking forward to continuing our discussions and learning from all of you!

          Hey all! Super excited to share I was just accepted to the West Coast March cohort! Big thanks to @Lucas and @Scott Hallock especially! And everyone else in the channel for all their kind words of support and help on problems! I wrote my very first line of code in August of 2022 so if you're just starting out, stick with it, you can do it!
          <br> Keep pair programming and ALWAYS BE COMMUNICATING. Even if you're stumped, tell the interviewer where your thoughts are, what you're stumped on, what you think might work, etc.
          <br> My interviews were something like :
          <br> • First Interview
          <br> - Variable Declaration
          <br> - Function Declaration (string manipulation)
          <br> - Callback Function
          <br> - Closure
          <br> • Second Interview:
          <br> - Simple Fxn
          <br> - Closure
          <br> - Closure
          <br> - Recursion? I think
          <br> • Third Interview Pair programming style:
          <br> - Closure
          <br> - Recursion
          <br> Suprise 4th Interview was solely OOP since my third interview was PP and took a while to get through because of the PP style. Felt very lucky to have the opportunity.

          Hey, y'all! Hope you're all doing well!
          <br> I got accepted into the ECRI cohort that starts in April, and wanted to thank y'all for all the help you've given me!
          <br> Massive shoutouts to @Jun Lee @Junie @Yining Wang @Julia @Melissa Herrera and @Lucas for all the help during my learning process.
          <br> CSBin, Pair-Programming, and this #mock_interview channel were absolutely key.
          <br> In case it's helpful to you guys, here's my learning journey of what I did. I mixed these up so I wouldn't get too comfortable with a particular learning platform and forget to write test-cases, debug on my own, etc.
          <br> Interview Prep Process:
          <br> - No previous coding background to start
          <br> - CSX Pre-Course material while I was still working full-time (quit my Band Director job at the Christmas Holiday Break)
          <br> - JSB and CSPrep back-to-back in Late November/Early December
          <br> - CSX curriculum: Functions to OOP - 2x; Closure to OOP - 2x
          <br> - CSBin: Recursion and OOP - 3x; (it took me a long time to be able to solo-solve all CSBin Recursion problems; OOP had a light-bulb moment that came sooner; recursion is still tough lol. Pair Programming with people smarter than me helped me learn a lot)
          <br> - mock_interview GitHub Problems (1 or 2 every couple days)
          <br> - CodeWars for String/Array Manipulation and Recursion practice (the search filters helped me narrow my work into specific concepts; difficulty stayed low at 8 or 7 mostly so I could get comfortable using all the string and array methods)
          <br> - Pair Programming with people 2-3 times a week
          <br> - JS The Hard Parts Youtube on Recursion and OOP
          <br> - 1 OOP Workshop
          <br> - 1 Pair-Programming Workshop
          <br> - Three mock-interviews with different people
          <br> - I spent between 2-6 hours a day on all the above items depending on the day; (I gave myself a day off from coding every 5 or 6 days)
          <br> - I gave myself 2 days off after each technical interviews to decompress from the grind (I was accepted after the second technical interview)
          <br> Good luck to everyone, and please reach out if you want any help! I was a teacher, so I love the learning process and helping others haha.

          Hello everyone! :) I was accepted about a week ago and just want to preface everything with the fact that I knew absolutely ZERO about coding a couple months ago. If I can do it, I promise you can do it too.
          <br> I was aiming for the February cohort and the deadline for the cohort was the same day as my interview :smiling_face_with_tear:
          <br> • 1/14 - Traditional Interview-
          <br> - Variable Declaration
          <br> - Function Declaration (string manipulation)
          <br> - Callback Function
          <br> - Closure Problem
          <br> - Recursive Problem
          <br> - OOP (constructor function declaration) - time ran out
          <br> -This interview was a bit odd in the sense that I wasted so much time on the string manipulation problem but breezed through the recursion and OOP. I spent so much time trying to understand recursion during my preparation that I completely forgot some fundamentals! Ultimately, time is what made me go back for a second interview
          <br> -Although Codesmith generally recommends waiting 2-3 weeks for your next interview, I felt like I was confident in my ability to pass so I booked the next available time - against my interviewers recommendations.
          <br> • 1/23 - Traditional Interview-
          <br> - Function Declaration
          <br> - Recursive Function (rebuilding an array method using recursion)
          <br> - OOP declaration
          <br> - OOP method #1
          <br> - OOP method #2
          <br> - The wording for the second OOP problem was something I never encountered in any of the mock int or csx problems, it was pretty difficult but by some miracle I was able to solve it just as time ran out. Never made it to the stumper
          <br> My advice:
          <br> - Pseudocode - Like most of you, I hated pseudocoding. But I realized good pseudocode is when another person can write out functional code from your pseudocode alone. It also sections your code in a way that makes finding and debugging your code easier
          <br> - Think out loud- I know it might feel dumb at first but thinking out loud essentially makes it so that you never go silent during your interview. When you’re stuck just repeat the things that you know and follow it up with “But, I’m not too sure why… x isn’t working”. I know it can be difficult to think and speak at the same time but the more you practice the easier it should get.
          <br> - Technical Communication- make this a habit. It is one of those things that you should just start incorporating in your vocabulary so it becomes second nature. If you’re doing a problem alone just technically communicate out loud. It’s going to be difficult if you’re thinking about how to solve a problem while simultaneously thinking what’s the correct technical vocabulary for the thing you want to express.
          <br> - Teach/Pair-Programming- a popular saying is- you don’t truly understand something if you can’t teach it. Pair programming was probably the most essential part of my journey. It allows you to not only learn but also exchange tools that you never knew was possible. Teaching something can help you understand a concept even more.
          <br> - Stay Curious- When things don’t work- stay curious, this allows you to never be frustrated when unexpected errors happen. It’s easy to get discouraged and question your abilities when you’re stuck but if you just adopt the mentality of wondering why or what caused it- you just open yourself up to more learning!
          <br> and my biggest piece of advice:
          <br> - Believe in yourself. You’re so far ahead of what you were a day, a week or even a couple months ago. I was recommended to delay my enrollment and aim for the March cohort because I didn’t pass my initial interview- but I refused to believe I wasn’t capable and ended up being able to join the earlier February class that I initially planned for.

          Hey, everyone!
          <br> I just took my first technical interview and had to say that it was a really fun journey. I felt a little nervous throughout the entire interview, and when that happened I somehow just started to talk to myself like a weirdo .:joy:
          <br> I am pretty sure I will need to have another interview because I ran out of time to do any  OOP questions. I think I wasted some time on re-reading the questions when I try to come up with solutions and on trying to format my code to match the logic of the pseudo code. I definitely ran into some little bumps on details, like missing a parentheses or forgot to apply console.log().
          <br> The questions I was given include:
          <br> 1. Create a variable and assign it to a value.
          <br> 2. String manipulation
          <br> 3. Callback function
          <br> 4. closure
          <br> 5. recursion
          <br> We then ran out of time after I completed recursion. I did the recursion challenge with help because first, I totally forgot that it is a recursion question as I went, and just started solving it as a regular one, I had to change my strategy after I was reminded. And then I also got stuck at one point and didn’t know how to fix it, so  he gave me a hint that helped me remove that road block out of the way.  I was able to complete the recursion question in the end but definitely not  a smooth ride.
          <br> One thing I would like to say after taking this interview is that, I do believe practicing pair programming helps A LOT! I didn’t do much pair programming in the past for all kinds of excuses, but I did spend 8 hours yesterday to do just pair programming and mock interview, and I can already feel a big difference on my communication and on my deeper voice.
          <br> So here, even if I don’t know my feedback yet and certain that I won’t pass on this interview, I am pretty happy about the outcome, and the fact that I have learned so much from some amazing people who showed me what good programmers look like. A big shoutout to @Ian who gave me tremendous help with pair programming, and supported me until the last minute before my interview (literally). And also big shoutout to @Scott Hallock and @Junaid Ahmed who helped me with mock interview.
          <br> At this point, I don’t have much to contribute but I did realize that being persistent and keep doing pair programming is really important and will make a big difference. :heart:

          Hello everyone! I was accepted last week! I have enjoyed reading everyone’s interview experiences and as I was accepted last week I thought I would share my own.
          <br> • 12/19 - Traditional Interview-
          <br> Simple variable declaration, simple function, higher order function, callback function, recursive function, 3 OOP questions, stumper function, recursion stumper function
          <br> * Feedback:
          <br> - Strengths: JS, Technical Communication, Debugging, Clarifying questions
          <br> - Areas for Improvement:
          <br> +) Be more conversational throughout the process, form complete sentences when debugging, example: instead of  “oh, I need to do this instead.” I could say something like ’oh I see on line 20 I used assignment when I intended to use strictly equal and that cause this when I was anticipating this
          <br> +) Use the const keyword instead of let for function declaration
          <br> +) Be more explicit with my pseudocode.
          <br> * Prep for this interview:
          <br> - I did the first 3 freeCodeCamp certifications early last year and then kinda stalled out in self study, then in early december I worked through the entire CSX and really got comfortable at solving all the questions as well as the CS Bin questions.
          <br> - I also pair programmed with other people for around 30 total hours. I like pair programming so I do a lot of it. This was the best for prepping as it really gets you good at technical communication and thorough understanding of what’s happening in JS.
          <br> • 1/6 - Pair Programming Interview-
          <br> - Stumper function, Stumper permutations recursion
          <br> - The feedback I received for this was good, great marks across all categories. I was accepted.
          <br> My Feelings on this interview:
          <br> - I was expecting to switch back and forth, but I was just navigating the entire time. The technical communication accuracy expected during this interview was way higher than I anticipated. I had to be very very explicit in my communication and pseudo code or the interviewer would write very strange code.
          <br> - I wasn’t able to run the code without first line-by-line communicating the function call. So for my second solution, as I used a permutation recursion algorithm, I probably spent 30 minutes of the interview technically communicating the function calling itself over and over with slight changes and forking.
          <br> - This interview was very stressful haha
          <br> * Prep for this interview:
          <br> - I mostly just pair programmed every day for a few hours, which is I think the most useful thing to prepare for the interview.
          <br> - I also reworked all my CSX answers and CS Bin answers til I was really happy with them. Focusing on not using for loop and using the built in methods, I also focused on re-answering all the recursion CS Bin questions without using any extra parameters which is rewarding.
          <br> - I did maybe 15ish leetcode problems, but idk if I would say this is totally necessary.
          <br> - I did 5 or so of the mock interview questions, those are great, especially for OOP.
          <br> My overall advice is to primarily focus on pairing, if you pair with someone farther along than you they can show you interesting techniques you wouldn’t have thought of, and if you pair with someone not as far along as you, you get a really good understanding of the concepts through technically explaining them.
          <br> If anyone has any questions about my experience I am around and feel free to message me, or respond to this thread
          <br> Thanks to everyone that helped me, big-time to Nick Stillman for the very thorough an thoughtful responses in CSX-challenge-help, to me and others, and big thanks to @Lucas for all the work on this channel and for the interesting code challenges.

          <br> *I was asked to provide either a challenging problem that I could not solve yet or a problem that I have solved and can teach someone else how to solve. I could choose to either be the driver or navigator.
          <br> Interview Feedback
          <br> Each of my interviewers commended me on my strong understanding of JavaScript. They acknowledged my ability to analyze the problems and code out my solutions. Here are some of my feedback regarding areas for improvement:
          <br> Debugging (1st interview)
          <br> - console logs should be your best friend, consistently console log the evaluated result of your functions. When there are errors, you will need to strategically place your console logs at different points in your code which will help you trace your steps back.
          <br> - All of the questions in my first interview were very similar to the ones on csbin. I was able to explain my strategy and quickly code the solution. I did not think to do any debugging.
          <br> My advice: Even if you are 100% confident in your solution, put some console.logs() in key moments of your code. For example, if you are accessing elements in an array, console.log() each element before and after running them through your function.
          <br> Thoughtful communication (2nd interview)
          <br> - Thoughtful communication is just as important as technical communication. Pair programming is a chance for you to connect with other engineers.
          <br> - This one was hard for me to grasp. I am fairly introverted and was somewhat nervous during the interview.
          <br> My advice: It usually takes the interviewer a few seconds to find the next problem and paste it into the csbin. Take this time to make small conversation with them! I actually wrote down some questions I could ask my interviewer.
          <br> - What else do you do at Codesmith?  So you've worked on the website?
          <br> - What was the program like? When did you graduate? How did you manage your time? What was your OSP about?
          <br> - What did you do before you came to Codesmith? That's nice to know ... I am a insert profession here  .... talk about your current job
          <br> Study Path
          <br> • Front End Engineer path at Codecademy (3 months +)
          <br> - This is where I learned most of my JavaScript fundamentals.
          <br> • All of CSX (1-2 days)
          <br> - I was able to quickly go through each unit. To get a sense of technical communication, I watched the accompanying hard parts recording for each unit.
          <br> - I attended a few live hard parts sessions to get practice talking about code with people.
          <br> • All of CSbin (few weeks)
          <br> - I did the recursive unit of CSbin on my own. The rest I did in pair programming.
          <br> - I scheduled my first interview a few days after my first ever pair programming session
          <br> • 10+ Pair Programming sessions (few weeks)
          <br> My Recommendation
          <br> Be prepared! You will want to go into the interview with a strong understanding of JavaScript. A good gauge is CSbin. Be able to explain the ins and outs of the solution for all CSbin problems.
          <br> Practice coding with other people! Pair program as much as you can. Get used to talking with another person while you code. Help less experienced people work through CSbin. Ask more experienced people for assistance on the more challenging stuff.
          <br> I hope this helps! I am happy to pair program and do mock interviews for those that needs it - DM me.
          <br> peace and love :v:

          <br> Study Summary:
          <br> - Went through CSX & CSBin twice, revisited some CSBin units for practice
          <br> - Used Codeacademy & FreeCodeCamp to make sure I had a good foundation in the beginning; FreeCodeCamp also has good practice for algorithms
          <br> - Answered questions in the #csx-challenge-help channel - this is really helpful to see how in-depth your knowledge is!
          <br> - Went to Hard Parts Workshops for units I felt I needed more clarification on
          <br> - Mock interviewed once - helped a lot with technical communication!
          <br> - Asked a lot of people a lot of questions:sweat_smile:
          <br> - Did a couple OOP questions from the Github
          <br> - Set a timer for 1 hour, set up a set of questions for myself similar to the format of interviews based on what I've seen on this channel, and ran through it on my own!
          <br> I'm not sure I can offer any more advice on top of all the great advice that's already been offered in this channel, but my DMs are always open so feel free to ask any questions:slightly_smiling_face:
          <br> Will also try to open up availability for mock interviews here and then before my immersive begins!

          Hi guys! Super pumped to say that I received my acceptance call today. I’ll be joining the March PTRI cohort.
          <br> • 1/4- Traditional Interview

          <br> 9. Stumper
          <br> Study summary (~2.5 months)
          <br> -MDN and Youtube: They were my best friends!
          <br> -CSX and CSBin: Worked through them multiple times, until I could solve each challenge with ease and explain them out loud while recording myself.
          <br> -Hard Parts lectures: Attended or watched them all at least once. Did the OOP one a few times to solidify, this was super helpful.
          <br> -CS Prep: Suuuuper great for honing technical communication. I found I was able to get a lot out of it by already being familiar with the concepts covered before attending, that way I could focus on technical communication and best practices instead of just learning the content for the first time in that setting.
          <br> -Pair Programming: Attended a few sessions via the Codesmith workshops but also just found some great people to work with individually in the slack channel. Overall did about 10-12 PP sessions.
          <br> -GitHub Mock Interview OOP Challenges: Starting with Storage Class and Ordered List was helpful, and if you can solve all the challenges posted there, you can likely breeze through any TI OOP problem.
          <br> -3 Mock Interviews: HUGE thank you to @Sid Brodsky, @Lucas and @Carolyn Zheng for those. This was hugely helpful. Doing about 3-5 mock interviews should expose you to pretty much any type of problem you can receive on your TI.
          <br> -Lastly, the #csx-challenge-help was such an invaluable resource. I had so many kind people reach out to me individually when I was struggling and offer help and encouragement like @Chris Suzukida. The Codesmith community is full of people to help you learn and grow, and utilizing that resource was crucial for me.
          <br> I'm so thankful for everyone who helped me get here and can’t wait to keep coding and improving alongside y’all! :tada::computer: I am always available and happy to help anyone out on their journey.

          <br> 5. Pair Programming - did 3 pair-programming sessions via Codesmith workshop, and additional 1:1 sessions with other students
          <br> 6. mock interview 1 - feedback: was given improvements for my technical communication, code efficiency, and showed I needed to learn certain common methods (big ty @Austin Mattus)
          <br> 7. mock interview 2 - feedback: learned I needed to familiarize myself with even more common methods, work on speeding up my time spent on solution/pseudocode, and work on writing more efficient code (TY @Lucas)
          <br> 8. Methods  - needed to learn more about common methods, so I would watch some YT vids and spent time reviewing MDN on common array/string/other manipulation methods
          <br> 9. csbin 2nd time - reworked thru recursion and OOP csbin problems
          <br> 10. mock-interview github - practiced a few of the OOP challenges, this was really big in preparing me
          <br> Overall, I feel like the most impactful factors in my learning were pair programming & mock interviews. I'm very grateful for this channel and the supportive folks that helped me along the way! And really big shoutout to @Lucas for his hard work in this mock-interviews community and the github, seriously this place is great thanks to your help.
          <br> I'm happy to chat w/ anyone with questions or who wants to pair program, etc, hit me up!

          Good morning. I want to share that on Friday the CodeSmith team called me to say that I have been accepted into the East Coast full-time immersive program, April 10 - July 7 cohort.
          <br> This group has been an indispensable resource for me passing on the third interview attempt—yikes! I thank those of you that have pair-programmed with me, those of you who have shared your past experiences, and most especially those of you who blessed me with a mock interview: @Lucas and @Ben Huang
          <br> my first interview I had some basic questions at first, declare an array, make a simple function like num*2 or something of the like, then a callback question like you'd see in csx, then a closure problem, and a recursion problem. All of them were pretty much of the sort you'd see on csx or csbin, not even the hardest ones either. But for some reason I got stumped on one.
          <br> my second interview started with recursion, and immediately went into OOP which I was woefully underprepared for! The OOP problem was like the sort you'd see in the github, or the two newer OOP problems in csx. You need to be extremely comfortable with the new keyword, 'this', and using Object.prototype
          <br> I hired a tutor off of fiverr to work with me for 10 hours on OOP going through every one of the github OOP problems, and I came back to my third interview with a vengeance. Nailed the OOP section, then they hit me with a stumper problem, I think it was called Pascal's Triangle. Went a hair over time but with the interviewer's hints and questions, I was able to solve it.
          <br> first two were regular interviews, third was a pair programming one.
          <br> Anyway, I'm excited to get extra prepared for the April EST Cohort. If anyone is looking for some pair programming, I am more than happy to do that, although my schedule is a bit weird.
          <br> If you've passed, then great for you. If you're not there yet, write down specifically what you need to improve in and face down that beast! God bless you guys. I'm wishing you all more than luck.

          Hello all!  I got my acceptance call, so excited!!  I'll be in the Jan 30th West Coast Remote.  Thank you so much @Lucas for the mock interview & for your guidance with my questions, and for the awesome github challenge questions!!  Thanks to everyone in this channel & to my cohorts from CS Prep 82 for your help & inspiration!
          <br> • 1st technical interview (traditional) 11/29:
          <br> - covered strings, arrays, callbacks, closure, recursion.  I had just gotten an OOP question & was starting to talk about overall strategy when I ran out of time.
          <br> Feedback received 12/2:  read prompts carefully ( I made some errors from overlooking parts of early questions, and correcting those took up extra time) , and review OOP to be ready for 2nd
          <br> • 2nd technical interview (traditional) 12/10:
          <br> - all OOP - constructors & methods
          <br> - Acceptance received 12/16
          <br> My preparation:  I began with almost no knowledge of coding, no familiarity with javascript.  In April 2022, I did JSB.  Then from May to Sept I was in the midst of moving, so wasn't working on coding.  In early October, I restarted, and over the next 2.5 months attended all of the Javascript Intro & Hard Parts workshops.
          <br> - Many of the workshops I also watched on YouTube, some multiple times.
          <br> - Attended CS Prep - super valuable!  The instructor & fellow students were really supportive.  CS Prep really helped my technical communication & grounded me with the foundational concepts.
          <br> - Completed all of CSX once, and ran through some sections a 2nd time.  I found the #csx-challenge-help channel really helpful for problems I struggled with.
          <br> - Went through all of CS Bin, some sections a few times.
          <br> - Used Youtube for other instructional videos (programming with Mosh & Namaste Javascript are great)
          <br> - Used MDN, W3 Schools, Free Code Camp, and Codewars for practice & learning.
          <br> - If I got super stuck & looked up a solution to a problem, or on Codewars when I would look at others' solutions to a problem I had completed, I would walk through it & make sure I understood why those solutions worked, and what each step was doing.
          <br> - Another thing I did if I felt stuck during studying was to either take a break & go on a walk, or to work on a different type of problem, and then later return to the challenging one.
          <br> - Mock interviewed once - I can't recommend enough!  That mock interview made me feel very prepared for my first TI.
          <br> - I also practiced by setting a timer for an hour, and running through a series of questions pretending I was being interviewed & explaining out loud what I was doing.
          <br> Good luck to everyone on their journeys!  Be patient & kind to yourself, and keep practicing!  :blush::seedling::evergreen_tree:

          <br> Acceptance received 12/8.
          <br> Preparation (2 1/2 months) - I have previous coding experience, self learnt using Udemy tutorials and other online recourses.
          <br> 1. Did entire CSX once — suggest you to rewatch the videos at the beginning of each module if you have difficulty understanding the concepts. Videos by Will Sentance and Philip Troutman are just awesome! Look up their videos on YouTube. I’ve never understood any concept as throughly before.
          <br> 2. Attended all the workshops — also helped me understand the concepts throughly, practice technical communication, use the right terminology and get feedback from the instructors.
          <br> 3. Attended CS Prep — helped me a lot with technical communication, though it was for two weeks, I got a sense of how classes are held at Codesmith, support from excellent teammates who helped me with pair programming, solve challenges and practice for the interview.
          <br> 4. Did CSX second time from the beginning, and redid the closure, recursion and OOP parts 3rd time.
          <br> 5. Did CS Bin twice.
          <br> 6. Practiced few string manipulation problems from Freecode camp
          <br> 7. Mock interviewed twice.
          <br> 8. Did all the OOP problems in the GitHub for my second interview and were really helpful. Thank you for your feedback, @Lucas!
          <br> Good Luck to all of you on their journey! Keep practicing and don’t give up! If you have questions, please feel free to DM me here on Slack. :pray::slightly_smiling_face:

          Hey folks! Just got my acceptance today! ( I technically got into to the January East Coast remote but I’m looking to switch to the March Central Remote cohort if I can). This channel has been immensely helpful and I wanted to thank everyone in it and to pay it forward. Sorry in advanced this write up is so long!
I spent a few months really delving into the material. I started with The Odin Project but when I decided to pursue a bootcamp (with Codesmith being my first choice), I used CSX as the outline of my learning and ended up going through CSX/CSBin a few times until I felt comfortable with the material. I decided to go to CSPrep with the goal of making sure I was good with my technical communication (and I’d totally recommend it for that reason). I did one mock interview and reviewed a lot of the material in the AWESOME mock interview github.
          <br> • First Interview (Nov 23) :
          <br> - Array declaration
          <br> - Function declaration (string manipulation)
          <br> - HOF/callbacks
          <br> - Closure
          <br> - Recursion
          <br> - OOP part 1) constructor  part 2) add method to constructor (pseudocoded it out but ran out of time)
          <br> Recommendations for interview prepping:
          <br> - If you are used to using a different code editor, make sure to spend some time working with in CSBin only. I personally love VSCode for all its debugging tools (not going to lie they are great for really figuring out what’s happening in my code) BUT it hurt when I had to switch from using VSCode to practicing in CSBin because it was a lot less comprehensive (like seriously trying to find a extra parenthesis in CSBin is way more annoying)
          <br> - Re-do CSX, CSBin but only read the prompts and code it all out yourself. The interview won’t provide the general structure nor will it provide test cases for the most part. I thought I could easily go through all the problems, and turns out I wasn’t solid with a lot of the syntax when I had to code it out myself.
          <br> - Practice working through problems like it’s the real deal for an hour straight (whether by yourself or with a mock). Check how you communicate, but also check how you manage your time! It shocked me how much slower I was when doing this, so I made sure to practice and figure out a balance between being fast and communicative/clear.
          <br> - If you can think of multiple ways to implement a solution that you’re equally confident in, consider doing the way that’s more advanced and/or faster, while being easy to understand. As an example I realized that I took way longer to explain, pseudocode, and code a for-loop versus accomplishing the equivalent behavior with an array method (forEach, map, etc), so for my interview I knew to stick with the methods if it made sense to. However I’d still try to keep things comprehensible, so for example I’d still write out 3 different lines for 3 methods (or sometimes just one line of pseudocode explaining that i’ll use 3 methods to achieve an end goal) but then code 3 lines out rather than chaining 3 of them together.
          <br> - Paraphrasing this point from April Sanders’s feedback on the github - have a rhythm. Mine was: Read question, set up input/output, define test cases (also call out edge cases), vocalize high level strategy, pseudocode, code.  During my actual interview, I had a notepad file open that literally had a template that had each of these on a line “input:  output:  test cases: console.log()” . The interviewer would see me copy/paste that into the page each time because I didn’t want to forget or spend time typing the same things over again.
          <br> - To add to that above workflow, I’d also make sure to check in with my interviewer when appropriate. For example: I’d finish pseudocoding out a solution and ask if it seemed clear, or I’d ask if i should code for a certain assumption/expectation. Don’t feel hesitant to talk to them.
          <br> - Be careful not to let your pseduocode mess with your code and syntax. Many CSX video solution videos write the pseudocode out and then code between the lines. I found that messed my syntax up way more so I chose to keep all my pseudocode together and then code after all of it. Do whatever is more comfortable for you.
          <br> - When practicing, if there was code that I could write but didn’t know how to verbally communicate, I’d sometimes watch relevant CSX solution videos to get a sense of how the speaker talked about it. That helped fill some gaps (but you can also ask folks in the slack too).
          <br> - If you’ve already read a lot of the previous interview feedback or done mocks, you may have noticed some of the things that get repeated that may not have been clearly written in any Codesmith official material. “Write your input/outputs first”... “use more ES6”... “include your semi-colons”... I asked the person on the acceptance call if there were any solid rules about what they expect and if they were available somewhere. Their response was that no one really gets dinged for the small things (like not using enough ES6), but at the end of the day they want you to be able to show your skills for those principles (analytical problem solving, technical communication, engineering approach, non-tech communication, and JS and programming experience) and they want you at a certain level. If you’re not, you’ll get feedback to help you prepare for your next try and if they happen to notice those smaller things, they will add it into the feedback because why not. I mention this now because I spent the last couple days before my interview agonizing about all those semi-colons that I might forget. So if anyone else overanalyzes and worries about everything written in this slack channel, this tip is for you lol.
          <br> And just a couple general tips if you’re reading this but maybe you don’t have an interview soon:
          <br> - If I needed a “break” from studying but still want to do code things, I’d do practice problems outside of Codesmith stuff. I liked Codewars a lot. I especially liked doing easier problems, and then looking at other solutions submitted. If there were any that seem smart or elegant or cool, I’d take the time to figure out how it worked. This was especially helpful for learning so many of the built in methods.
          <br> - Another “break” option: read through question on #csx-challenge-help. I started answering more questions because doing so 1) forced me to get better at debugging code that I wasn’t as familiar with since I didnt write it 2) gave me a chance to practice technical communication because I knew it might be harder to explain something through slack so it forced me to try to be more precise
          <br> - Be curious and be resourceful! If you don’t get something, look for other sources of material to try to make sense of it. While working through CSX, I also read/watched/worked through through the equivalent material from other bootcamps (Fullstack videos and problems, a little bit of reading from Rithm school, practice problems from Hack Reactor,). MDN/ W3SChools/ javascripttutorial.net/ FreeCodeCamp/  were great, as were many other pages that came up in my google searches lol. Sometimes there was just one page that somehow magically made things make sense to me. Sometimes I’d even search this slack to see if someone else asked about a question and what sort of explanations showed up. If after all that I was still stuck, I tried to either take a break and hope it made sense later, or reach out to someone to get a hint (not an answer!) to hopefully get me back on track. If I did have to end up looking at an answer, I spent a lot of time really making sure I understood it. After all, maybe that one problem would end up on my interview lol.

          <br> Acceptance received 12/1
          <br> Prep (2 months) - I began as a complete novice to coding at the beginning of October.
          <br> 1. Did CSX once and CSBin once.
          <br> 2. Attended CS Prep at the end of Oct -- this helped a lot!
          <br> 3. Mock interviewed twice.
          <br> 4. Did 5-6 problems in the GitHub - these were also great prep.

          Hi everyone, I was just accepted into the NYC Onsite Immersive (February start). I'd like to start off by thanking everybody that so graciously spent the time to give me a mock interview and provide thoughtful feedback: @Nancy Zhang, @Sean Flynn, @Dawit Merid, @Austin Mattus, @Alyssa Denary, @Jessica Wang, and @Huse. I cannot understate how invaluable these were, so I will be providing mock interviews  myself on a week-to-week basis. You can sign up on the following link: mock interviews calendly, which I've also linked on the other spreadsheet. Specials thanks as well to @Lucas for creating this channel and @Chris K. for hosting study sessions every Saturday, which really challenged me to prepare above and beyond for my technical interview. And thank you to all of the wonderful, hard-working people that I've met along the way so far. It's been a real pleasure learning alongside so many amazing people, the Codesmith community is truly unmatched.
          <br> • 1st Technical Interview - 11/21
          <br> 1. variable declaration
          <br> 2. helper function
          <br> 3. callback
          <br> 4. closure

          <br> 7. OOP method
          <br> 8. OOP method
          <br> 9. stumper
          <br> A bit long winded, but below you will find the preparation that I specifically did and some general advice I have that worked out for me.
          <br> Preparation (2.5 months):
          <br> 1. JSB
          <br> 2. CS Prep
          <br> 3. All easy parts workshops
          <br> 4. All hard parts workshops
          <br> 5. 15+ pair programming sessions
          <br> 6. CSX 1-2x
          <br> 7. CSBin 2-3x
          <br> 8. Leetcode (50+ easy problems)
          <br> 9. 3x Saturday study sessions w/ Chris K.
          <br> 10. 2 weeks of Mock interviews and review
          <br> Advice:
          <br> - Consistency is key. Keep yourself accountable by keeping track of how much studying/programming you are doing each day. Workshops, pair programming sessions, prep classes (JSB/CS Prep), etc. are great ways to get at least some exposure to Codesmith and programming on a consistent basis.
          <br> - If you are just starting out, I would highly suggest signing up for JSB and CS Prep. These programs point you in the direction that Codesmith is looking for you to get to. They are great opportunities to learn from and teach your peers, pair program, do assignments/projects with others at all levels. As the saying goes, you get in what you put out, so really participate given the chance and take the assignments seriously.
          <br> - Attend as many workshops as you can early on. They help you get a sense of where your peers are at and at what level you should expect yourself to eventually get to. They also provide opportunities to practice technical communication and receive feedback from instructors. If you cannot attend workshops, I would suggest you watch the relevant recorded workshops on Youtube by Will Sentance or Phillip Troutman. They are amazing teachers.
          <br> - Attending Codesmith's weekly pair programming sessions and scheduling your own private sessions with your peers is a great way again to practice technical communication, but also to learn the different ways that people solve the same problems. Schedule sessions with peers of all levels, you will have the chance to both learn and teach then.
          <br> - Go through CSX at least once, and then multiple times for the sections you are unable to solve quickly. Take the time to understand the solutions if you find yourself falling back on looking up the answer. The first run through of CSX will be very difficult, but you will get the hang of it given time and sufficient effort.
          <br> - The same goes for CSbin. You should go through CSbin problems at least once, and then repeatedly until you are proficient.
          <br> - If you have the time and would like to challenge yourself, I would suggest checking out 'Easy' level Leetcode problems. This is actually where I got in a lot of my practice in the latter half of my studying.  I found it enjoyable to do 1-3x problems per day, and every problem has a ton of resources online with regards to different solutions. You do have to sift through problems as most of the problems will not necessarily be relevant to what Codesmith expects of you. I mostly treated Leetcode as a fun challenge and a way to build up my coding 'toolset.' You get a ton of practice with the different JS methods available to you, and other general programming strategies. Leetcode problems will force you to be very creative in how you utilize your tools and challenge how much you understand each tool. It is very different from simply recalling the answers on CSX or CSbin problems for example.
          <br> - On the final stretch of your studies, I would highly recommend attending Chris K's Saturday study sessions, scheduling mock interviews through this channel, and continue working through CSbin problems both by yourself and through pair programming. Mock interviews will be the most powerful resource, in my opinion, to gauge if you're truly ready or not and what areas you need improvement on.
          <br> - Lastly, be kind to yourself, especially early on in your studies. There will be times you feel way behind everybody else. Developing as a programmer is a marathon, not a sprint. Take the extra time for yourself as needed. Do the easy/simple things on the days you're feeling off, and then push yourself when you feel in the zone.
          <br> If you have any questions, please feel free to DM me on slack. Also, I'd be happy to connect on Linkedin for those interested: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-hoang-004882251/">my Linkedin profile</a>.

          Hi everyone! Just got the call that I was accepted to Central Remote cohort! Thank you for everyone that reached out when I had questions and to everyone that mocked/pair programmed with me. This channel was an invaluable resource and so thankful for this community!
          <br> • 1st Technical Interview: Traditional

          <br> - OOP, build a constructor function
          <br> - Add methods to the function
          <br> - Closure
          <br> Advice:
          <br> 1. CS Prep - I found CS Prep completely vital to my journey (I'm not being sponsored by Codesmith, lol). I pretty much only started coding when I decided to enroll in CS Prep. I'm the kind of person that needs structure and feedback. Therefore having an instructor to immediately ask questions and fellow students to work with really helped ingrain knowledge and taught me the right terminology/structure for my technical communication. So if you're anything like me and need a more formal setting to help enforce material, I would recommend CS Prep, especially since it technically doesn't cost you extra.
          <br> 2. CSX/CSBin- Do them at least 3 times. I pretty much created several accounts with CSX so I could start afresh each time and not "cheat" by accidentally seeing my answers.
          <br> 3. Mock Interview/Pair Programming- schedule as many mock interviews as you can with anyone that takes you up on your offer. I also found it very useful to delete all the pre-written test cases as my first step, because my first interview I struggled with it since it wasn't something I practiced doing.
          <br> Hope this helps some of you and let me know if anyone wants help!  Good luck everyone and hope to meet/see some of you soon!

          Hi everyone, I was just accepted to the West Coast Remote cohort today. Many thanks to this community for helping me along the way!! Special shoutout to @Lucas and @Ruqayaah S. for providing me with mock interviews. Thank you as well to @Ben Huang, @Alyssa Denary and @Huse for the pair-programing seshes. It took me 3 interviews which I definitely DO NOT recommend. The process gets lengthy and could be daunting. However, if you stick with it, you'll get it!

          <br> - OOP, build a constructor function
          <br> - Add methods to the function
          <br> - Stumper - object related question
          <br> My advice is to:
          <br> 1. Do CSX and CS Bin a couple times over.
          <br> 2. Pair-program with others as that will play a huge part in improving your technical communication and you'll see other approaches to solving a problem.
          <br> 3. Do mock interview.
          <br> That said, thanks again to this community! Hope this feedback was helpful to anyone in the process. Good luck to all in their upcoming interviews!

          Hi everyone! I just got accepted to the West Coast remote cohort and I really couldn't have done it without all the support I received on this channel and all the tips in the mock interview library so I wanted to share my experience as well! Shout out to @Sean Flynn (who gave me a mock when I definitely wasn't ready and ended up having to tutor me), @Dawit Merid, and @Lucas for the mock interviews, @Huse for all the advice/tutoring/supportive comments, and @Santi Lorenzo who worked through a bunch of problems with me.
          <br> 1st Technical Interview: Traditional - 9/28
          <br> - Variable declaration
          <br> - Function declaration
          <br> - Callback
          <br> - Callback
          <br> - HOF (potion question)
          <br> 2nd Technical Interview: Traditional - 10/22
          <br> - Array declaration
          <br> - Callback function
          <br> - HOF
          <br> - Closure (similar to csbin questions)
          <br> - Recursion (pretty basic, similar to CSX questions)
          <br> - OOP constructor (The question wasn't necessarily more difficult than csbin, but I felt like it was worded differently than what I was used to and ended up spending wayyy too long on it)
          <br> 3rd Technical Interview: Pair Programming -11/11
          <br> - OOP constructor
          <br> - OOP method
          <br> - Stumper was a hard recursion question
          <br> Honestly I was super nervous going into the pair programming interview but it ended up being my favorite interview experience! I don't know if my experience was typical because I think it kinda depends on your interviewer? But for mine, I was the **navigator for both OOP questions. I had a decent amount of time left after those two so my interviewer and I switched roles and we ended up refactoring the code a bit before moving on to the stumper. The stumper had concepts that I honestly never even heard of before and the prompt made no sense to me at first lol so I tried my best to ask a lot of clarifying questions/look up some things and I think my interviewer could see that I was trying really hard to understand the prompt and ended up basically pair programming the question with me so technically I did end up solving it (with lots of help). I was able to learn a lot during that interview and the only negative feedback I received was: -come up with test cases before starting the problem,
          <br> -my usage of a method that although worked, wasn't really best practice for the OOP question (which is what we refactored during the interview).
          <br> Tips/Thoughts:
          <br> - Practice & really understand what you're doing! I went through CSX multiple times but at some point realized that I couldn't really explain what I was doing well, it was almost just me memorizing the steps because I've seen the questions so many times at that point.
          <br> - Utilize the slack channel! Doing mock interviews really helped me boost my confidence for the technical interviews & honestly the coding challenges in the mock interview library are really really good. I feel like if you can do those, you can probably solve the questions on the technical.
          <br> - Book the codesmith mentoring sessions if you can! Since I failed two interviews, I actually ended up booking two with two different mentors and they both helped me a lot. One gave me a mock interview and basically tutored me on my weak points/gave me a bunch of different questions to work on in my own time while the other gave more general tips based on the feedback I received and also gave me some resources to study.
          <br> - Don't go silent!! That was my biggest issue with my first two interviews whenever I hit a block with debugging. Really take things line by line and use the console to have a visualization of the data being manipulated so you can try to identify the source of the error. Try to explain what you're doing and why. My mentor mentioned that sometimes the interviewer may try to guide you in the right direction, but they can't do that if you're silent and they don't know what you're thinking!
          <br> I still have a lot to learn but feel free to reach out if you have any questions! :blush:

          <br> - OOP constructor function
          <br> - OOP method
          <br> - OOP method
          <br> Some takeaways from my interview experience:
          <br> - From both of my interviews, my interviewers really like to see the ES6 syntax, especially when its a one line of code, you could use the implicit return of the arrow function to make your code clean. Just remember to not to use it for OOP when you will use this keyword. Try to use the ternary operators for some simple if else statement.
          <br> - Pseudocode is important from my experience. Although I’ve been told it’s also depend on the interviewers’ preferences. It’s always a good idea to ask for the interviewer if your pseudocode looks good or if you want to skip the pseudocode for a simple variable declaration problem.
          <br> - Don’t be afraid to ask questions when the prompt is not clear and there might be edge cases not clarified. They love to see you are trying to truly understand and you think thoroughly about the problem.
          <br> - Try to keep your code nice and clean with the right formatting. Don’t forget about the semicolons as they are taking note of it. Follow the Airbnb style if you could. <a href = "https://github.com/airbnb/javascript">https://github.com/airbnb/javascript</a>
          <br> - Practice practice practice. I went over CSX and CS Bin problems 4-5 times and yet every time I would still learn something new. Practice the problems as you will do in the actual interview: read the prompt out loud, communicate your overall strategy, write out the inputs and outputs, pseudo code your steps, code while communicate your code line by line, and try to build your own test cases since sometimes they are not provided, and you could also add your own test cases to test for edge cases.
          <br> - Go to as many workshops and attend as many pair programming sessions as you can. It not only build your technical communication skills, but also help you get used to the mentality when your technical communication is somewhat been assessed by others. Codesmith can see how many sessions you attended. As I spoke with them they said they were impressed with how much effort I put into the preparation because I attended so many workshops and pair programming sessions. Your effort will be seen.
          <br> - Do mock interviews if you can book any and/ or go to the Saturday study buddy sessions in the channel #jshp-study-buddy-big-ol-group Those are really great resource to hone your interview and problem solving skills under pressure.
          <br> - Record and time yourself when you practice problems. This helped me notice lots of areas of improvement in my technical communication and gave me a better idea of my pacing.
          <br> - If you have zero JavaScript knowledge before working on CSX and you are struggling with the technical communication especially when English is not your first language as like me, I’d highly recommend CS Prep. It’s totally worth it if you are determined Codesmith is the one. But personally I’d suggest go in after you go over CSX and CS Bin at least once to maximum the result.
          <br> Hope this helps. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Good luck everyone in your upcoming interviews!

          Hi everyone, I got accepted to New York onsite immersive Dec cohort a week ago. I have been busy moving and finally have some time writing this to share my experiences. I took three technical interviews in total and here are the dates and problems I ran into.
          <br> • 1st Technical Interview (9/10)
          <br> - Type: Traditional
          <br> - Duration: 1h
          <br> - Feedback Date: 9/20
          <br> - Variable declaration
          <br> - Function declaration
          <br> - Callback function (one-line function, addOne)
          <br> - Callback function (one-line function, subtractOne)
          <br> - Higher Order Function(String manipulation - Potion)
          <br> • 2nd Technical Interview (10/15)
          <br> - Type: Traditional
          <br> - Duration: 1h
          <br> - Feedback Date: 10/18
          <br> - Variable declaration
          <br> - Callback Function
          <br> - Higher Order Function
          <br> - Closure
          <br> - Recursion (Basic)
          <br> - OOP constructor
          <br> - OOP method
          <br> • 3rd Technical Interview (10/25)
          <br> - Type: Traditional
          <br> - Duration: 1h
          <br> - Feedback Date: 10/28
          <br> - OOP constructor
          <br> - OOP method
          <br> - Recursion (Hard-Construct 2D array)
          <br> Overall tips:
          <br> :exceptionally_fast_parrot: About pacing - I was worrying if I over explained sometimes that takes more time to get through problems. This really depends on people’s perspective. For people who would love to challenge themselves to crack the technical interview on the first try, pacing is essential. Reaching the hard parts and solving 8-10 problems in total within an hour definitely requires a lot more than that. I’ll say it’s an art of balancing a variety of metrics. For people who prefer breaking the process down like me, I would suggest focusing on quality of problem-solving first. For each problem, show off what you’ve got to impress the interviewer even just a simple one. Some brownie points such as, use the ES6 syntax; or while testing, read a test case in a strict technical fashion e.g. “I’m logging the evaluated result of calling xx function when passing xx value to the console and I’m expecting the result xxx” ;
          <br> :white_check_mark:Build up your own problem-solving routine - I benefited from this a lot since my second technical interview.For every problem I solved during the interview, I followed these steps:
          <br> a) Read the prompt;
          <br> b) Define the input and output of the function;
          <br> c) Write the code of function declaration (only the function label, parameters, put the curly braces in place);
          <br> d) Set up the test cases with expected result;
          <br> e) Communicate the overall strategy;
          <br> f) Write pseudocode;
          <br> g) Write real code;
          <br> h) Test with test cases and debug…
          <br> - From step a-d, I found it is helpful to have test cases ready before I started to talk about solution. It helped me to understand the prompt in depth. And I got positive feedback on this practice from the interviewer.
          <br> - People might have other sequence they’d prefer to follow. It does not matter only if the routine serves thought process and efficiency. Practice with routine couple of times before interviews.
          <br> :exploding_head:For String/Array Manipulation problems - For the specific group, the purpose is to test control flow, looping and array/string methods. If stuck, it will slow us to get to closure/recursion/OOP. The tricky thing is that the interview problems would be harder and slightly different than problems on CSX/CSbin. Beyond that, I’ll recommend to look for couple of more challenging problems, good examples are: potion problem(l think people shared this before in the channel), compress, uncompress, anagrams (from Structy). I ran into the potion problem in my first technical interview and I was totally bummed. Looking back, the problem is feasible without knowing any further knowledge but it need time, practice and repetition to feel comfortable solving it during interview. For people who will be in CS prep, Problem of the Day are a good resource to understand fundamental patterns and the efficient execution of code in common groups.
          <br> Thank you everyone. I really appreciate the enthusiasm in the channel:fire::sparkling_heart:! Feel free to ask me if you have any question!

          Interview : 2nd interview
          <br> 1st question was to declare an array
          <br> 2nd question was to check for even
          <br> 3rd question was to create a func that accepts an array and a callback func. Then to return the index of the last elem that resulted true when passed in the callback
          <br> 4. An easy closure problem
          <br> 5. An easy recursion problem. the func will have an input of an array and callback. the aim was to get a new array with the elements being the result of invoking the callback func while passing each element as an argument.
          <br> 6. OOP problem. the aim was to create an obj that acts like a set (so similar to the obj acting like an array).
          <br> Tips:
          <br> - Watch out for the Time. Always practice while timing yourself
          <br> - Do the problems from previous interviews. In my opinion , code wars and leetcode are a bit advanced and would be a waste of time.
          <br> - Warm up with some coding before the interview
          <br> - Practice using map, filter, and forEach methods.

          Hello everyone. I got the call saying I was being offered admittance into the Central Remote this coming January after my first technical interview. To be honest I was expecting to have to conduct a second one. I went so far as to schedule another mock with @Lucas  before I even heard the results. Speaking of which I don’t think I would be typing this if it wasn’t for him, and @Alyssa Denary for offering mock interviews. As well as everyone else who has posted their experience in this channel.
          <br> First Interview: 10/27
          <br> - Variable declaration
          <br> - String function
          <br> - Callback
          <br> - Closure
          <br> - Recursion
          <br> - OOP constructor
          <br> - OOP method
          <br> - OOP method
          <br> Overall:
          <br> I think for me the biggest issue when I first started doing mock interviews was my pacing. I could get through the problems eventually, but I was just so slow. I ended up doing 4 mock interviews before the technical and I definitely got more comfortable with the format/pacing as I progressed through each mock. The questions do seem to follow a similar progression so when practicing I would seek out problems which seemed similar in style to the mock interview questions I was given. Everyone is different, but for me personally I spent a lot of time on closure/OOP and would go through any related CSBin, CSX, or past mock interview questions that were related. I can’t stress enough how impactful the mock interviews were to me. I would take the feedback and slowly build towards better communication, pseudocode, and general problem-solving ability. They also helped solidify my ability to think out loud during problem sets, and without that familiarity I likely would have been silent during much of the technical.
          <br> Feedback Received:
          <br> +Technical communication
          <br> +Ability to think out loud
          <br> +JavaScript knowledge
          <br> -Solutions could be simpler
          <br> -Afraid of the for loop
          <br> -Changing approach is ok
          <br> Thanks again to everyone on this channel for sharing their experiences. If anyone has any questions feel free to contact me.

          Hi everyone, I just took my first technical interview with the sweetest interviewer...yet I was still sweating buckets and typing with trembling fingers LOL
          <br> So. I know 100% I will be called for a second interview because I got stuck on the closure problem and never made it to any OOP problems. I thought I understood closure pretty well, until I had to make my own test cases. I just completely blanked on function definitions vs function calls, assigning function definitions to variables using arrow function syntax, etc. Little stuff that made me realize I can't depend so much on CSX pre-written test cases. That threw me off the most!! Make sure you practice writing your own tests.
          <br> So info about interview:
          <br> - Interview date: 10/28/2022
          <br> - Interview number: the very first
          <br> - Interview type: traditional
          <br> - Duration: 1 hour
          <br> - Cohort: ECRI in January/CTRI in January
          <br> Questions:
          <br> 1. Simple variable declaration question
          <br> 2. string manipulation
          <br> 3. callback
          <br> 4. closure
          <br> 5. recursion
          <br> I was able to finish the recursion question in the last few minutes, but like I said earlier, I was stuck debugging the closure function for a while. I had all my code written. Then I just...blanked when my test cases were returning the function definition and not my result. My interviewer gave me advice to push me in the right direction so I could talk through my debugging process without melting into a puddle XD XD
          <br> But yes...I realized how spoiled CSX made me. I think to practice for the next one I will use CSBin and add in at least one more test case that I create myself.
          <br> Obviously I just completed my interview so I don't have the feedback yet, but once I get it I will update everyone here!! I wish I found this channel earlier. I am going to try to sign up for a mock interview to prep for the next one, thanks to all of you in advance

          Overview of my interviews:
          <br> First Interview - taken Friday, Oct 10th
          <br> 1. Variable declaration/assignment
          <br> 2. String manipulation function
          <br> 3. Callback/HOF
          <br> 4. Closure/HOF
          <br> 5. Recursion with a string input
          <br> 6. OOP: create a constructor function
          <br> I knew there was a chance OOP could be covered (my test was a few hours before the “official” announcement on slack) but I spent a majority of my prep focusing on the difficult closure problems that I struggled with in mocks. Figured there was no point in studying OOP if I couldn’t even get to those problems! I leaned heavily on MDN and took my best shot at the prompt but I was pretty sure I’d be asked for a second interview starting with OOP.
          <br> Second Interview - taken Wednesday, October 19th
          <br> 1. OOP: constructor
          <br> 2. OOP: Add a method accessible to all instances
          <br> 3. OOP: another method but much trickier
          <br> 4. … a real doozy. A “stumper” unrelated to OOP.
          <br> Overall takeaways:
          <br> - Technical communication: Sometimes people miss the forest for the trees with this. Yes, there are words you should avoid and others you should say, but good technical communication is always rooted in comfort with the material (in my opinion). Thoroughly understanding what you are asked to do and how you’ll go about solving it will go a long way in speaking clearly and effectively. Conversely, a lack of understanding becomes very apparent when communicating your approach, thought process, etc. (especially with OOP).  In other words, once you are really comfortable with the subject matter a lot of the technical communication will come naturally: you’ll know what to say because you deeply understand the shortcomings of the incorrect terms and the reasoning behind the proper ones.
          <br> - Pseudo code: there are already a lot of great resources here but I’ll just reiterate what I think is the most essential point: keep it casual! Your pseudo code shouldn’t include specific method names, lengthy descriptions of what will happen, etc. Think of it as a recipe written for someone who knows how to code, but maybe not in JavaScript.
          <br> - Tough problems: Even more so lately, the exam will throw tricky variations and wrinkles at you, even in the earlier problems. A few things to keep in mind with these:
            <br> - Don’t get quiet! It’s easy to be overwhelmed and nervous, and if you’re like me, you start running through all the different ways you may approach the problem in your head. Verbalizing this process is a great way to demonstrate your knowledge while keeping your interviewer in the loop.
            <br> - Keep a positive attitude! Interviewers are looking to see your mental/behavioral approach too; tackling these problems with curiosity and enthusiasm goes a long way.
            <br> - Know your stuff! There’s no substitute for straight up knowledge and ability, and the more practice you have, the better you will fare. And think of coding as a trade, like carpentry: acquire all the tools you can and know them inside-and-out . Then, when you come across a weird/complex problem, you’ll have a full arsenal to choose from and can identify the best tool for the job.
          <br> Hope this helps!

          Hey all, found out I was admitted to the EC full-time cohort in January after two interviews like @Huse (congrats to him!). Going to take some to think about it over the weekend but I'm just glad to know finally since feedback has been a bit slow to get to us East Coast/Central applicants. Thanks to my mock interviewers from this channel @April Sanders, @Camille Salter, @Cee L, @Lucas, and @Alyssa Denary. Super appreciate all of your time and helpful comments! And also thanks to anyone else I talked/ranted to about how I have no idea what I'm doing with my life lol.
          <br> There are a few examples of people detailing their interviews so I'll just give a general rundown and if anyone has specific questions feel free to reach out.
          <br> First Interview:
          <br> -Variable declaration
          <br> -HOF problem using declared variables
          <br> -Sort of weird closure problem (probably the hardest on this interview)
          <br> -Easy recursion problem
          <br> -OOP set that I didn't do great on
          <br> Second:
          <br> -Really similar format to the first which sort of threw me off
          <br> -Two HOF problems with some string manipulation
          <br> -OOP set different from the first interview
          <br> I think having strong technical communication/problem-solving skills in the first interview made it so that the second one was just brushing up on things. And I will say that the advice they give to not stop talking even when you're stuck really helped me. I was stuck on a string manipulation problem in the second interview for much longer than I wanted to be and thought it reflected poorly on me. But then when I got my call, they mentioned that my ability to keep composure and work through blocks like that was a strength. So at least for me, it's hard to be objective on what really happened after the fact (esp. when the feedback takes a bit to get to us), but just do your best! Feel free to reach out with any questions or if you might need a mock interview.

          Hello! I was accepted into the west coast Jan 30th cohort, and wanted to say thank you to everyone on this channel - it's been amazingly helpful!! Super special thank you to @Huse for giving me a mock interview and very valuable and actionable feedback :smile:
          <br> For interview prep, I focused on my weak areas: technical communication (high level strategy, pseudocoding, communicating while coding, thinking out loud through roadblocks), recursion, and OOP.
          <br> For technical communication, I went through CSX and CS Bin problems and recorded myself while solving them. Then I would listen to the recording as objectively as I could, make some mental notes, and try to incorporate improvements on the next round. I did this over and over until the cows came home... and of course, nothing beats objective feedback like a mock interview, but recordings helped a lot when the mock interview calendar was full!  :slightly_smiling_face:
          <br> Added bonus from the recordings - after a while , you start to get a feel for how long you're spending on problems based on the length of the recording. This was helpful since I was also worried about timing and talking too much / too little / spending too much time on a single problem (how to find the right balance!?)
          <br> Some other things I personally find useful for encountering recursion and stumper problems:
          <br> Working through examples (i.e., 'if I call function X with argument A, I should expect result B. If I pass in argument C, I should expect result D.. ') and looking for patterns. This will also give you an opportunity to ask your interviewer clarifying questions, as well as identify and create test cases and edge cases!
          <br> Breaking the problem down... What is the simplest possible input or scenario you could work with? Figure that one out, and try to work your way up from there.
          <br> Hope this helps - good luck everyone!!

          Hi team, I got into the West Coast December cohort following my 2nd interview. I got the call the day after the interview. I am extremely grateful for the support, advice and tips from this channel, Y’all are amazing! I want to shout out @Lucas, @Camille Salter for giving me mock interviews, @Alyssa Denary and @Sean Flynn have generously shared so much with me.
          <br> I took one week to prepare my 2nd interview and heres some feedback I got from those two interviews:
          <br> - Solidify your understanding of OOP and how to implement them.
          <br> - write tests for cases that may result in all possible output.
          <br> - Time management. Speed up the process.
          <br> - Use ES6 syntax more often if you can.
          <br> - If there is any way I can help you with anything, please let me know. I wish everyone the best of luck in their interviews too!

          Hello everyone, I took my first technical interview about a week ago. I have been called back for a second interview. The feedback I was given was to use es6 syntax more often and to practice with objects. My advice to people taking their first interview would be to not be too afraid. Many of the questions are not too difficult. If you’re doing mocks and CSX, you will have adequate practice. And if a problem is easy, try to work a little faster, it helps save time for later problems.
          <br> Having said this, would anyone be willing to do mock interviews with me within the coming week before my next interview. The topics would be more on recursion, OOP, and possibly async. There’s not much availability for the kind people on the spreadsheet, so this may be a shot in the dark.

          Hi everyone, this is how my interview went on 14-SEP. I received acceptance on 29-SEP, so two weeks later
          <br> Here's how it went:
          <br> - Interview date: Sept 14
          <br> - Interview number: 1
          <br> - Interview type: Traditional
          <br> - Duration: 1h
          <br> Problems:
          <br> Problem 1: Same as everyone, first problem was creating a variable. If it specifically says variable, use let if it's an obj or array, use const . 
          <br> Problem 2: Si mple for loop question to find min max of an array.
          <br> Problems 3, 4: Simple one-liner functions such as addOne, subtractOne, isOdd, isEven, isNegative, isPositive. You get the gist of it. These are the helper/callback functions that will be used in a later question.
          <br> Problem 5 Callbacks: Use all the functions that you created in problems 3,4 as callbacks. My question was a string manipulation question: loop through each character of the string, if satisfying a condition, assign the current char position to the invocation of the callback function. I think we usually refer this question as potion question.
          <br> Problem 6 String Manipulation/Handle: isPalindrome.
          <br> Problem 7 Recursion: getLength
          <br> Problem 8 Closures:  I had a closure question for returning specific element from the input object.
          <br> Problem 9, 10 Challenge question: Similar to everyone, I got question for transpose and rotate 90o of a 2D array.
          <br> My Experience:
          <br> Time went by so fast. The more I talked and treated the interviewer as a teammate, the more relaxed I became.
          <br> Feedback I got from interview:
          <br> - Good technical knowledge. My instructor did not say any further than this
          <br> They like that I asked for edge cases like:
          <br> - Am I expecting only positive number, negative number
          <br> - What if the input is this, how do you want me to handle
          <br> - What if after I return all elements in my object, what do you want me to return next if we invoke this function again?
          <br> - Am I always expecting numeric input or a string or a mixture
          <br> I got compliment on my debugging. My instructor asked me what was going on my mind when I debugged, I said:
          <br> First of all, I always make sure my indentation is correct. If the indentation is wrong, I know I'm missing some closing brackets or having syntax error in previous lines so I fix those immediately
          <br> Then when running code and we receive an error message. I learn to be familiar of the meaning of the error message. If this is the first time I see that error message, I will google it to understand what kind of situation would result in the error.
          <br> If I know what the error mean, then I will fix my code accordingly.
          <br> If I have location where I think the error is coming from, I will comment out the part of the code until I know exactly what line causing the error and fix it
           <br> If running the code and I got incorrect result (a.k.a logical error)
          <br> I start tracing/skimming my code until I find an area that I think cause the incorrect result, then I use console.log to ensure the function is working the way I want it to do
          <br> Hope this helps!

          My approach over the month of prep  and 2 Technical Interviews  can be boiled down to the list below. Hopefully it helps someone.
          <br> Interview Prep
          <br> - CSX & CS Bin – I repeated these over and over again. It’s not just about refactoring your code; it is also about getting used to the questions to the point where a specific question triggers a specific approach in you. Because every single minute counts, you want to spend as little time as possible on each question, so having your approaches ready really cuts down on time spent thinking up a solution.
          <br> - Pair Programming – This is the space to make mistakes, try out new things and have someone carry you over the hurdles that you are facing. If your partner is more skilled, you learn a lot. If they are around the same level as you, then you have room to experiment, fail, and solidify your understanding of the concepts. If you are the more skilled partner, it is an opportunity to teach and grow someone else as you have been grown.
          <br> - Mock Interview – This is the place to get that technical interview feel, and yes, it is extremely stressful. Watching that hour trickle away as you struggle with one problem can feel quite soul-crushing, but you keep doing it and it keeps getting better each time you do it. This is the time to:
          <br> - Practice your technical communication with an objective observer
          <br> - Figure out whether your pseudocode is too sparse or too long
          <br> - Get used to coming up with test cases and edge cases
          <br> - Encounter those mind-bending string manipulation questions (my personal hell). I had not encountered these before, and really struggled with them.
          <br> - Encounter recursion problems like you haven’t seen them on CS bin
          <br> - Above all, just gain the confidence to express yourself in a technical scenario.
          <br> - You will have to ask clarifying questions, especially when it is a complex question that is not immediately clear
          <br> - You will have to talk through your thought process
          <br> - You may have to explain why you have changed your strategy mid-way
          <br> Interview
          <br> - High Level Strategy – This is a general picture of how you want to approach the problem. Make it as clear as possible without it being detailed.
          <br> - Pseudocode – This is a step by step written record of what you want to do. You want to find a balance between too detailed and too short, a balance that I am still working on. In my initial mock interviews, I was informed that my pseudocode was too short, and in my first technical I was told it was way too detailed. Ideally don’t spend so much time pseudocoding that it eats into your coding time.
          <br> - Technical Communication / Coding – These two occur simultaneously. Because of all the work leading up to the interview, the coding bit is rarely the problem. Talking as you code though … can be tricky. My personal approach is to start speaking before you code, this way you don’t forget to communicate as you code. Try to be as precise as possible and mention everything from template literals (I forgot this in my 2nd technical interview), to invoking a function. I even mention line numbers, in case I go back up the code and add something to the code, or change something in the code, this way your interviewer is with you all the way.
          <br> - Overall Summary – In the event that your strategy got turned around a few times while solving a problem, take time at the end to walk through your solution again to reorient your interviewer.
          <br> - Test Cases & Edge Cases – My first mock interviewer I had no idea what an edge case was, by the end I sort of did. I think of an edge case as a test that your code was not designed to accommodate. Like passing in a string instead of a number, or only accounting for an array with elements and not an empty one etc. Try to think about possible edge cases as you solve a problem, this way your solution can handle any test case introduced by the interviewer. That said, you will not always be able to account for all edge cases, if your code fails a test try to go back and account it for it within your code. The more edge cases you encounter, the better you become at anticipating them in the future.
          <br> - Finally, failing feels terrible, but it also shows you what you need to work on. There are things that will take you some time to get e.g., recursion without using loops, native methods, or the length property, and sometimes doing them under pressure you will falter. But you’ve come this far, so clearly you are in the right place, doing the right thing, and with a bit more practice you’ll get it.

          Following @Lucas post
          <br> My first interview was yesterday, and here's how it went:
          <br> - Interview date: Sept 27
          <br> - Interview number: 1
          <br> - Interview type: Traditional
          <br> - Duration: 1h
          <br> Problems:
          <br> Problem 1: Same as Lucas and @April Sanders, first problem was creating a variable. If it specifically says variable, use let if it's an obj or array,  try using  const .
          <br> Problem 2: Involved simple iteration like using a for-loop or for-of loop. This was simple.
          <br> Problems 3, 4, 5: Problems that returned booleans. Think, check if this number is a negative, or an even number...etc Like Lucas and April's, these were simple one-liner conditional statements. I think they're testing you on ES6 syntax, like the arrow functions, and making sure you're not using unnecessary else statements.  I got feedback that I should have used arrow functions.
          <br> Problem 6 Callbacks: Use all the functions that you created in problems 3,4,5 as callbacks. They are making you rebuild the 'Every' method.   I would say this was a lot easier than the problems in CSX. If you could do the problems in CSX, you will definitely know how to do this one. Also I got feedback from @Vivian O in the mock interview to try to use array methods like map or filter, instead of using for-loops for every problem. Even if you want to use for loops, explain why you choose not to use the array methods and explain why using a for-loop is the best approach. I used for-loops for every problem, but I explained why and that's probably why my interviewer let it slide.
          <br> Problem 7:  isPalindrome, I don't think you have to solve this one recursively. But I think the reason they give this problem is because they want to see if you write unecessary code, or because of time/space complexity? I am not too familiar with those concepts, but I know that the loop doesn't have to go through the entire string to check if it's a palindrome. You could just check half of the string, or once you find an instance of 2 letters that don't match, you can just exit out of the loop early and return false. No need to iterate through the entire string to check if it's a palindrome. I got feedback that my space complexity was good, but not time complexity.
          <br> Problem 8 Closures:  If you did closure problems in CSX, you're fine. Think beginning closure problems in CSX.
          <br> Problem 9 Recursion: Like Lucas and April's, this one was a simple recursion problem. But the language kind of threw me off a bit, because it said you can't use loops or JS methods.  Again, think beginning recursion problems in CSX, like the first 2-3. I would say even the first CSX recursion problem is harder than this one.
          <br> Problem 10: Like Lucas and April's this was the 2D array problem. This was a super duper hard problem that I didn't finish. I think they give this to you on purpose to see how you handle being stuck. I had a mock interview with @Nicholas and he mentioned that he had a game plan for when he got stuck, and that advice very useful for the actual interview. Just keep thinking out loud and if you have an outcome that isn't what you expect, start from the top and console log to make sure all your expected values are correct. I'm not sure if this is good advice on getting stuck, so lmk what you would do, I'd like to learn too!
          <br> Feedback I got from interview:
          <br> - Good: Easy to follow, verbalized the entire process, organized pseudocode,  liked that I included inputs/outputs, wrote and console logged test cases before solving a problem (I had around 2-3 test cases), no unnecessary else statements
          <br> - Improvement: use more ES6 syntax (arrow functions, switch statements), could add more edge cases, good use of space complexity but need to think more about time complexity
          <br> Make sure you schedule as many mock interviews with @Lucas and @Ruqayaah S., these 2 are a wealth of knowledge. I did horrible in my first mock with Lucas, and only did 2 problems. It takes practice, and it's a different experience from pair programming and solving problems yourself. Also join the study group on Saturdays by @Chris K., also a wealth of knowledge! You learn so much from his feedback as well as how other people solve problems.
          <br> Hope this helps! And feel free to message me if you have questions or want a mock interview!! I got A TON of help from these guys over the past month, so I need to pay it forward!

          Hey Lucas! This is a great idea, I’ll share my experience as well :
          <br> Interview date: September 9th
          <br> - Interview number: 1 (accepted after first TI)
          <br> - Interview type (pair-programming/traditional): Traditional
          <br> - Duration: 1 hour (the entire interview was dedicated to problem solving)
          <br> - Cohort : CTRI - Jan 16th
          <br> I went through 10-ish challenges :
          <br> My interview was very similar to Lucas’ interview :
          <br> - first problem was creating an array
          <br> - the next four problems were helper functions that were one-liners using a function expression
          <br> - the following problem was a callback that asked me to use the previous helper functions
          <br> - my next problem was string manipulation - I was asked to refactor this problem multiple times (isPalindrome, for those who are familiar); I don’t think being asked to refactor this much is normal, but it’s helpful to feel comfortable solving problems in different ways (recursively, using methods, iteratively without any methods, etc)
          <br> - then, I had a recursive problem that was very basic and similar to what is in CSX
          <br> - after that, I had a closure problem of similar difficulty to CSX problems - after solving the closure problem, I was asked to go back and edit the code slightly to produce a different outcome
          <br> - stumper problem - transpose. I didn’t finish this problem  (I didn’t know how to, even though I’d seen it before), but I did try to talk through what I was doing
          <br> Thoughts / Tips / Advice :
          <br> - For me, it was helpful to have a consistent way to solve each problem. If you don’t already have it, it can be helpful to have a rhythm (example - for each problem, I’d : read instructions & set up my input/output  > declare function & set up function definition > create test cases > take my hands off the keyboard (to reduce my own anxiety and tendency to start pseudocoding prematurely) and explain my verbal strategy > put hands back on keyboard & pseudocode, rereading problem if necessary > code / debug / re-summarize if needed)
          <br> - Treat the interview like you’re teaching them how to solve the problem; making it conversational definitely reduced anxiety for me
          Do mock interviews (obviously lol)! I can 100% say that I wouldn’t have gotten in without doing my first few mock interviews. I think 2-4 interviews seems to be a sweet spot, and gives a chance to get comfortable with your own rhythm and pace. Not everyone needs them though. If you can talk aloud while solving, or maybe even record yourself and go back and watch the recording, that can serve the same purpose. Definitely based on the individual!
          <br> - As others have said, be mindful of syntax and using correct terminology, and if you use a method, or a way to solve a problem (recursion vs iteration, for example), take a second to explain why you’re choosing to do that - I think the interviewers like to see that you know why you’re doing what you’re doing
          <br> - lastly, it helped me to mentally visualize what was going on while I was reading. so if a problem involves two arrays and an object as parameters, I would see two arrays and an object in my mind and I’d imagine manipulating the keys, elements, functions etc to get your desired outcome. I know everyone’s mind works differently, but that definitely helped me! hopefully this makes sense, just ignore this bullet if it doesn’t lol :sweat_smile:
          <br> I did reach out to admissions about OOP/Async, here’s what I was generally told (don’t hold it against me if this isn’t 100% true for you though lol, things could have changed since I reached out at the beginning of September) --- if you’re heading into your second interview, you will likely have OOP if you make it to that point in the interview. If it’s your first interview and it’s scheduled during September, it’s unlikely that you’ll see OOP. Excerpt from response from admissions : “We are not officially making changes to the interview until early October, but we recommend getting familiar with OOP and Async regardless, as it’s always been possible that those concepts appear on our technical interview.”
          <br> If you have any other questions, feel free to DM me! I received so much help on this channel, and it made a big difference in my experience so I love to help others as well!

          Hey folks,
          <br> I’ve done my technical interview and wanted to note down something based on my personal experience, hopefully it keeps you updated.
          <br> - Interview date: Aug 07
          <br> - Interview number: 1
          <br> - Interview type: Traditional
          <br> - Duration: 1h
          <br> - I went through 9 challenges:
          <br> The 1st challenge was a warmed-up question that asked me to declare a variable, I think this one tested us on how to declare and initialize variables, so we should consider using a let or const keyword to create variables depending on different situations.
          <br> The next 2 challenges involved using simple iterations/loops to work with an array of numbers and strings, I think they were not complex, we should know how to use conditions inside the loop to branch our program, and carefully handle indices of characters from the string, etc.
          <br> The next 2 were just helper functions and they were so straightforward that I could use one line of code to complete these tasks.
          <br> The next one was a string manipulation problem and I think this was one of the challenging problems in this set (compared to others). It was something like ‘AB potions’, and I had to traverse through the string to update specific characters based on the requirement. Well, at first, I was a bit confused because I was thinking of some variants of this problem, like ‘A’ and ‘B’ could appear multiple times, ‘A’ and ‘B’ could be at the beginning or at the end of the string, and ‘A’ and ‘B’ could be consecutive in the string, etc, so I recommend you to clarify some edge cases with the interviewer since they may just want us to work with simple cases.
          <br> The next one was a closure problem and it wasn’t different from what we’ve done on CSX and CSBin, so I didn’t have any difficulties with this one.
          <br> The next one was a recursion problem, but again it was very similar to what we’ve practiced on CSX and CSBin, so I did it!
          <br> And the last one was a challenge on a 2D array, we should know how to work with multi-dimensional arrays to complete this one. Unfortunately, I got some bugs on my first attempt, and after trying to fix them, I came up with a working solution using loops. However, later I realized that it's better to solve this one with recursion.
          <br> ...And, I failed on this one :sweat_smile: Actually, I have failed many times, so just keep practicing :dart:
          <br> DISCLAIMER: This review is just from my personal experience, from what I got from my actual technical interview. But hopefully, it gives you some inputs to better prepare!
          <br> Best of luck with your interviews!
