          Hi all! -
          <br> I hope your week went well.
          <br> On this week’s updates on preparing for the immersive, the greatest lesson learnt that I want to share with you is the importance of being kind to yourself. Before I dive into giving updates on how to prepare for week two of the immersive, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the different struggles of everyone on their journey, trying to get acceptance into the program. It is easy to see one’s self as a failure if one has been trying to get in for a long time - especially when other folks who have tried for shorter periods get in before us.
          <br> It’s okay to be sad. But it’s not okay to give up. Maybe you need to change your strategy or mindset. Sometimes, it’s just about how much we want something (remember the fighting spirit/grit I mentioned last week you needed to be successful in the program?). To give you an example, I got acceptance in April but didn’t get to start until October - that was over 5 months of uncertainties and staying out-of-job. However, now, I say it was worth every single struggle. Breakthroughs come eventually and I hope you get yours soonest.
          <br> Anyone starting the program between next week and January would find these weekly pointers very helpful, in the magnitude of how many weeks they have before their start dates. In my bid to help you solve the problem of how to adequately prepare for the immersive in an organised way, I hope you find all the weekly pointers very helpful.
          <br> For this week’s updates, here we go:
          <br> IMO, week two was more intense than the previous week. But a very beautiful learning experience nonetheless. The summary of the week was DOM manipulation, AJAX and React.
          <br> Together with last week’s pointers, the few pointers I have for you after week 2 of the program are:
          <br> - Learn DOM Manipulation. You need not dwell on this much as most companies use frontend frameworks like React, Vue and Angular. I however recommend this course from freecodecamp for a good overview.
          <br> - Learn, practice and try to build a small project featuring AJAX/fetch API. Here are two good places to get started 1 and 2 without feeling overwhelmed or lost.
          <br> - Take things up a notch and use DOM manipulation to display data from the fetch API in the two resources above in your browser.
          <br> - Learn React by getting your hands dirty with building this game from the React JS official website. It’s a learning-by-doing approach that saves you time while teaching you all the concepts you need to know.
          <br> - A bonus would be to do all of the above with a study buddy after working on them alone to improve your technical communication by pair programming as you will be paired with partners throughout the program. Start getting comfortable with reading documentations too and searching Google for answers!
          <br> To everyone still trying to get in, please do not give up. I implore you to not give up. The community here is glad to help always and I wish I was able to continue to give mock interviews. I advise we take advantage of the awesome folks giving mock interviews while preparing for their programs to start. I want to shoutout to everyone on here helping others prepare for their technical interviews to get in, and a very big shoutout to @Lucas for his dedication and kind-heartedness.
          <br> Congratulations to folks who recently got in too.
          <br> I wish us all the best in our respective endeavours!

          Hi everyone!!!
          <br> For those that may have noticed, I have not been as active as I used to be on here. I began the immersive on Monday (it definitely feels longer) and it’s the end of week 1 of the immersive today. It’s been intense - as expected! But a very beautiful experience. I still want to be of use to folks on here so for anyone who’s got acceptance but yet to begin, I prepared a few pointers to help you prepare better!  One caveat though (as said by one of my cohort-mate) is that you’ll never be prepared enough! But we can be less not-prepared-enough, right?
          <br> This is what I have for you after 1 week of the program:
          <br> - Master Javascript Objects; prototypal inheritance & Object and Array methods. You will be needing this knowledge all through the program and real world.
          <br> - You want to practice as much algorithm problems as possible; I suggest practicing recursion a lot.
          <br> - You want to study or have basic knowledge of Data structures; Linkedlists, Queues, Stacks, Binary Search Trees (depth and breadth first) e.t.c. Structy is very good for this.
          <br> - Improve your technical communication by pair programming! You will do lots of pair programming in the immersive.
          <br> - This goes without saying but you want to know how to look for answers on Google! And be patient with digesting loads of information within a short time.
          <br> - I want to use this moment to encourage everyone trying to pass their technical interview to not not give up. You will need that fighting spirit to succeed in the program.
          <br> P.S: I apologise to everyone who’s requested for a mock interview since after last weekend or sent a DM I haven’t replied to. As much as I love to give mocks and teach JS, all mock interviews had to be on hold since Monday that I started. I advise we take advantage of the awesome people that have volunteered to give mocks and have been giving amazing mock interviews now that they are yet to begin their own programs.
          <br> I intend to drop pointer/preparation messages like this just once in a week - at the end of that week - to not steer focus away from the primary goal of the group.
          <br> Congratulations to folks who recently got in too.
          <br> I wish us all the best in our respective endeavours!
