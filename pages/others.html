          Hello everyone,
          <br> Xmas is coming to town! May the Christmas Season bring only happiness and joy to you and your family. On this special occasion, I've prepared a few challenges for you as a gift, and hope you enjoy it!
          <br> If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a comment on this thread as I'm happy to discuss further!
          <br> Merry Christmas!!
          <br> üéÖ Challenge #1:
          <br> Declare an object called 'XmasPrep' with the keys numbered from 1 to 12 and the corresponding values are things to do: "calculate days to Xmas", "shopping", "decorate home", "write letters to Santa", "wait for Santa distributes candies", "have a dinner", "build a Xmas tree", "movie and chill", "create a Santa's magic sack", "Time for game: flip titles", "check for lucky numbers", "form Youtube URL‚Ä¶and enjoy".
          <br> üéÑ Challenge #2:
          <br> Assume that Christmas day is on 25 December. Declare a function 'merryChristmas' that takes in a string with the expected format of 'DD Month'. Check if Christmas has passed or not, if not, return the message "Yea yea!! *days* days left to Xmas!", otherwise, return "It's been *days* days since Xmas :((". And if the passed-in string is Christmas day, return "üéÑ Merry Christmas üéÑ".
          <br> Note: All months and days are only applicable for 2022!
          <br> console.log(merryChristmas("23 July")); // 'Yea yea!! 155 days left to XMas!'
          <br> console.log(merryChristmas("25 December"));	// 'üéÑ Merry Christmax üéÑ'

          <br> üõí Challenge #3:
          <br> Declare a function 'shopping', which takes in an object (called 'market' with keys are items names and values are the corresponding prices) as a single argument and returns another function.
          <br> The returned function takes in a number (called 'budget') as an argument and returns an object containing all purchased items with their amounts. The shopper will prioritize buying as many different items as possible and then as much of each as possible.

          <br> ‚ùÑ Challenge #4:
          <br> In numerology, the number nine represents completion because it is the last of the single-digit numbers (known as cardinal numbers) and the highest in value. Having said that, it symbolizes a synthesis of knowledge and experience, and vibrates with the spirit of both endings and new beginnings.
          <br> And now‚Ä¶select up to 9 most expensive items among all the purchased and arrange them appropriately to return the longest chain as an array of strings in which the last character of the current string is similar to the first character of the next one (case-insensitive).
          <br> const cart = const cart = { 'Jingle Bells': 2, 'Elf': 1, 'Ink': 1, 'Garland': 1, 'Angle': 1, 'Holly': 1, 'Ribbon': 1, 'Tinsel': 1, 'Needlepoint Stockings': 1, 'Wassail': 1, 'Candles': 1, 'Hot Chocolate': 1, 'Wreath': 1, 'Red Velvet Bow': 1, 'Nutcracker': 1, 'Gift Card': 1 }
          <br> console.log(decorate(cart));
          <br> // ['Nutcracker', 'Red Velvet Bow', 'Wreath', 'Hot Chocolate']
          <br> üëº Challenge #5:
          <br> Declare a function 'formatAndCorrect', which takes in a string (a message from kids to Santa) as a single argument. The message is not well formatted (redundant spaces and characters are not capitalized after each punctuation) and because of their excitement, they may have misspelled the letters of Santa Claus's name (order and positions of the string 'Santa Claus' may be not correct). Help them proofread the letter, format it properly, and correct the places where Santa Claus's name is misspelled before it's sent. Don't forget to print out the error message if you find any typos, otherwise, print out "No typo detected".
          <br> The kids will be very grateful to you and they promise to give you presents from Santa when they receive them.
          <br> const message = "hello Stanan Clus,   my name's Frank and I am 9 years old.  i hope you're   doing well!!   i want you  to know  that I have been very  good this   year, and I listened to my parents. This year  I'd really like the Christmas Tree  Lego set to  start my collection. Thank you so much, Satan Claus .";
          <br> console.log(formatAndCorrect(message));
          <br> // 'Possible typo(s) dected from the 7-th and 270-th character(s)! -> All Fixed!'

This year I'd really like the Christmas Tree Lego set to start my collection. Thank you so much, Santa Claus."
          <br> üéÅ Challenge #6:
          <br> Declare a function 'distributeCandies', which takes in a positive integer (the number of candies) and an array of strings (names of nice kids for gifts), and returns another function.
          <br> The returned function takes in a string (called 'name') and a positive integer (called 'amount' ‚Äìthe desired amount of candy). When the returned function is invoked, it should return an object with the keys are kids' names and the corresponding values are the number of candies each of them can be distributed if all kids on the nice list have made requests, otherwise, return "Waiting for others in the nice list!". However, if the name is being sent more than once, return "Hey kid! Your request is being processed from the North Pole. I'm on the sleigh to your chimney!", and if the name is not on the nice list, return "Nahhh! You're not on the nice list for gifts! You might be a naughty kid, so here's coal for you!".
          <br> > Important note: Because the number of candies that Santa can carry is finite, the actual number of candies each kid could be received will be distributed based on the percentage of the amount that each kid requested with all the others on the nice list. After distributing, Santa will give the remaining candy (if there are any) to whoever has the least amount of candies.
          <br> const candies = 335;
          <br> const names = ['Ann', 'John', 'Lucas', 'Wey', 'Tom', 'Teo'];
          <br> const give = distributeCandies(candies, names);
          <br> console.log(give('John', 200));	// 'Waiting for others in the nice list!'
          <br> console.log(give('Lucas', 120));	// 'Waiting for others in the nice list!'
          <br> console.log(give('Teo', 20));	// 'Waiting for others in the nice list!'
          <br> console.log(give('Wey', 305));	// 'Waiting for others in the nice list!'
          <br> console.log(give('Ann', 10));	// 'Waiting for others in the nice list!'
          <br> console.log(give('Tom', 199));	// { John: 78, Lucas: 47, Teo: 7, Wey: 119, Ann: 6, Tom: 78 } -> John ~ 23%, Lucas ~ 14%, Teo ~ 2%, Wey ~ 35%, Ann ~ 1%, Tom ~ 23%
          <br> üçΩ Challenge #7:
          <br> Declare a recursive function 'haveADinner', which takes in an array of strings (names of foods) and a positive integer K. Return an array of strings containing K foods with as many foods distinct in the first character as possible, and the others (if any) are selected in descending order of the length.
          <br> console.log(haveADinner(['Salad', 'Kebab', 'Bread', 'Rice', 'Hamburger', 'Pizza', 'Cheese', 'Fish', 'Sandwich', 'Spaghetti', 'Bacon', 'Roast chicken', 'Sausage', 'Hotdog', 'Noodles', 'Waffle'], 9));
          <br> // ['Salad', 'Kebab', 'Bread', 'Rice', 'Hamburger', 'Pizza', 'Cheese', 'Fish', 'Noodles']
          <br> console.log(haveADinner(['Bacon', 'Hamburger', 'Salad', 'Hotdog', 'Sandwich', 'Smoked salmon'], 5));
          <br> // ['Bacon', 'Hamburger', 'Salad', 'Smoked salmon', 'Sandwich']
          <br> üë™ Challenge #8:
          <br> Declare a recursive function 'buildXmasTree', which takes in an array of strings (components of a Xmas tree), two partners (called 'Mommy' and 'Daddy'), a target (as a string) and an array of strings (the expected order of a complete Xmas tree). Assuming that at the beginning, Mommy is holding all components. Print out the process of building the complete Xmas tree by moving all components from Mommy to the final target with the help of Daddy, obeying the following rules:
          <br> - Only one component may be moved at a time
          <br> - Each move consists of taking the upper component from either Mommy or Daddy and placing it on top of another
          <br> - After a component is placed on the final target, it can't be moved around anymore.
          <br> const components = ['root', 'middle branches', 'upper-middle branches', 'bottom branches', 'top'];
          <br> const order = ['root', 'bottom branches', 'middle branches', 'upper-middle branches', 'top'];
          <br> console.log(buildXmasTree(components, 'Mommy', 'Daddy', 'FINAL', order));
          <br> /*

          <br> */
          <br> üçø Challenge #9:
          <br> Declare a function 'selectMovie', which takes in an array of arrays, a callback and a string (called 'quality'). Each movie in the movies array is also an array with two elements (the movie name (string) and its rating score (number)). The callback will take in a movie as a single argument and return a string representing the movie quality which is converted following the rules:
          <br> - From 0 to less than 2: Bad
          <br> - From 2 to less than 3.5: Fair
          <br> - From 3.5 to less than 4.5: Good
          <br> - From 4.5 to 5: Excellent
          <br> The 'selectMovie' should return the name of the movie with the passed-in quality and be as close to the average rating among all others as possible. If there's no movie satisfied, return "No movies satisfied!".
          <br> const movies = [["MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS", 5], ["LAST HOLIDAY", 2], ["KLAUS", 4], ["LITTLE WOMEN", 4.5], ["LOVE HARD", 3], ["THE HOLIDAY", 1.79], ["THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER", 5], ["A CHRISTMAS PRINCE", 3.7], ["WHITE CHRISTMAS", 4], ["ALIEN XMAS", 3.5], ["LET IT SNOW", 3.3], ["NOELLE", 2.5]];
          <br> console.log(selectMovie(movies, getRating, 'good'));	// 'KLAUS'
          <br> ü§∂ Challenge #10:
          <br> Declare a function 'SantaMagicSack', which takes in no arguments and returns an instance of a 'SantaMagicSack' object when invoked with the 'new' keyword. SantaMagicSack should function similarly to objects - i.e. they will store values as key-value pairs with keys are strings and values are objects. All SantaMagicSack objects should contain their own 'completeItems' (to keep track of the number of complete items added to the object) and 'totalLb' (to keep track of the total pounds of all added items) properties. When a SantaMagicSack is first created, it should initialize both the 'completeItems' and 'totalLb' properties to 0.
          <br> üç™ Challenge #11:
          <br> Declare a function 'ekle', which is accessible to ALL instances of 'SantaMagicSack'. 'ekle' takes in two arguments (a string called 'item' and a number called 'lb'), and when invoked on a SantaMagicSack instance, should add all characters of the item into the instance under an object with two properties:
          <br> - nums: the number of times a specific character appears
          <br> - lb: the number of pounds of a specific character (the pound of a character is the average pound of the string containing that character ‚Äìif it's not an integer, only take the first 3 digits after the decimal point)
          <br> Update the 'completeItems' and 'totalLb' property appropriately and return the total pound of the instance.
          <br> üîî Challenge #12:
          <br> Declare a function 'istemek', which is accessible to ALL instances of 'SantaMagicSack'. 'istemek' should take in a string (called 'item') as a single argument, and when invoked on a SantaMagicSack instance, should return the number of moves in the instance to form the input item. If it's not possible to form such an item, return "Sorry! Your request can't be met. Please come back later!". Assuming that once the input is satisfied, the number of complete items will be decremented by 1, update the 'totalLb' and 'completeItems' properties appropriately.
          <br> üß¶ Challenge #13:
          <br> Declare a function 'denetlemek', which is accessible to ALL instances of 'SantaMagicSack'. 'denetlemek' should take in a positive integer K as a single argument, and when invoked on a SantaMagicSack instance, should return the number of complete items with a length of K can be formed from the object.
          <br> /// Test cases for OOP challenges: from Challenge #10 to Challenge #13 ///

          <br> üåü Challenge #14:
          <br>Declare a function 'flipTiles' which takes in an NxN array as a single argument (N is an even number and all values in the 2D array should appear twice) and returns another function.
          <br> The returned function should take in three arguments ‚Äìa string (called 'player') and two numbers (called 'row' and 'col'). When the returned function is invoked, it should check if the current player opened two identical tiles in a row, if so, return "Congrats *player*! You're the winner!!!", otherwise, return "Cool! You opened *tile*" (with the *tile* is the value at the row-th and col-th indexes of the 2D array). And don't forget to greet the players if this is their first time in this game by printing out "Hey *player*! Welcome to the game!".

          <br> ü¶å Challenge #15:
          <br> Declare a function 'checkLuckyNumber', which takes in a number as a single argument and checks if the input number is a lucky number by following these rules:
          <br> A number is a lucky number if:
          <br> - All digits are in increasing order
          <br> - Sum of digits divisible by their mean (after rounding down)
          <br> If the input number is not a lucky number, check if it's possible to rearrange all the digits to form a valid one that follows the rules.
          <br> If a lucky number can be generated, return "Tada!! *num* is a lucky number.", otherwise, return "Can't form any lucky numbers from *inputNum*".
          <br> console.log(checkLuckyNumber(6594012));	// 'Can't form any lucky numbers from 6594012'

          Hi all! -
          <br> I hope your week went well.
          <br> On this week‚Äôs updates on preparing for the immersive, the greatest lesson learnt that I want to share with you is the importance of being kind to yourself. Before I dive into giving updates on how to prepare for week two of the immersive, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the different struggles of everyone on their journey, trying to get acceptance into the program. It is easy to see one‚Äôs self as a failure if one has been trying to get in for a long time - especially when other folks who have tried for shorter periods get in before us.
          <br> It‚Äôs okay to be sad. But it‚Äôs not okay to give up. Maybe you need to change your strategy or mindset. Sometimes, it‚Äôs just about how much we want something (remember the fighting spirit/grit I mentioned last week you needed to be successful in the program?). To give you an example, I got acceptance in April but didn‚Äôt get to start until October - that was over 5 months of uncertainties and staying out-of-job. However, now, I say it was worth every single struggle. Breakthroughs come eventually and I hope you get yours soonest.
          <br> Anyone starting the program between next week and January would find these weekly pointers very helpful, in the magnitude of how many weeks they have before their start dates. In my bid to help you solve the problem of how to adequately prepare for the immersive in an organised way, I hope you find all the weekly pointers very helpful.
          <br> For this week‚Äôs updates, here we go:
          <br> IMO, week two was more intense than the previous week. But a very beautiful learning experience nonetheless. The summary of the week was DOM manipulation, AJAX and React.
          <br> Together with last week‚Äôs pointers, the few pointers I have for you after week 2 of the program are:
          <br> - Learn DOM Manipulation. You need not dwell on this much as most companies use frontend frameworks like React, Vue and Angular. I however recommend this course from freecodecamp for a good overview.
          <br> - Learn, practice and try to build a small project featuring AJAX/fetch API. Here are two good places to get started 1 and 2 without feeling overwhelmed or lost.
          <br> - Take things up a notch and use DOM manipulation to display data from the fetch API in the two resources above in your browser.
          <br> - Learn React by getting your hands dirty with building this game from the React JS official website. It‚Äôs a learning-by-doing approach that saves you time while teaching you all the concepts you need to know.
          <br> - A bonus would be to do all of the above with a study buddy after working on them alone to improve your technical communication by pair programming as you will be paired with partners throughout the program. Start getting comfortable with reading documentations too and searching Google for answers!
          <br> To everyone still trying to get in, please do not give up. I implore you to not give up. The community here is glad to help always and I wish I was able to continue to give mock interviews. I advise we take advantage of the awesome folks giving mock interviews while preparing for their programs to start. I want to shoutout to everyone on here helping others prepare for their technical interviews to get in, and a very big shoutout to @Lucas for his dedication and kind-heartedness.
          <br> Congratulations to folks who recently got in too.
          <br> I wish us all the best in our respective endeavours!

          Hi everyone!!!
          <br> For those that may have noticed, I have not been as active as I used to be on here. I began the immersive on Monday (it definitely feels longer) and it‚Äôs the end of week 1 of the immersive today. It‚Äôs been intense - as expected! But a very beautiful experience. I still want to be of use to folks on here so for anyone who‚Äôs got acceptance but yet to begin, I prepared a few pointers to help you prepare better!  One caveat though (as said by one of my cohort-mate) is that you‚Äôll never be prepared enough! But we can be less not-prepared-enough, right?
          <br> This is what I have for you after 1 week of the program:
          <br> - Master Javascript Objects; prototypal inheritance & Object and Array methods. You will be needing this knowledge all through the program and real world.
          <br> - You want to practice as much algorithm problems as possible; I suggest practicing recursion a lot.
          <br> - You want to study or have basic knowledge of Data structures; Linkedlists, Queues, Stacks, Binary Search Trees (depth and breadth first) e.t.c. Structy is very good for this.
          <br> - Improve your technical communication by pair programming! You will do lots of pair programming in the immersive.
          <br> - This goes without saying but you want to know how to look for answers on Google! And be patient with digesting loads of information within a short time.
          <br> - I want to use this moment to encourage everyone trying to pass their technical interview to not not give up. You will need that fighting spirit to succeed in the program.
          <br> P.S: I apologise to everyone who‚Äôs requested for a mock interview since after last weekend or sent a DM I haven‚Äôt replied to. As much as I love to give mocks and teach JS, all mock interviews had to be on hold since Monday that I started. I advise we take advantage of the awesome people that have volunteered to give mocks and have been giving amazing mock interviews now that they are yet to begin their own programs.
          <br> I intend to drop pointer/preparation messages like this just once in a week - at the end of that week - to not steer focus away from the primary goal of the group.
          <br> Congratulations to folks who recently got in too.
          <br> I wish us all the best in our respective endeavours!
